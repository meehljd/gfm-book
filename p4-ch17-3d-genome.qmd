# 3D Genome and Spatial Models  {#sec-3d-genome}
**Label**: `@sec-3d-genome`  
**Old source**: **NEW CHAPTER**

**Conceptual goals**:
- Understand that the genome folds into 3D structures that affect regulation
- See that long-range contacts explain enhancer-gene relationships
- Recognize emerging spatial transcriptomics foundation models

**Key concepts**:
- Chromatin organization: A/B compartments, TADs, loops
- Hi-C and chromosome conformation capture
- Predicting 3D contacts from sequence: Akita, Orca, C.Origami
- TAD boundaries and their sequence determinants
- Connecting 3D structure to expression: the "missing link" in regulatory models
- Spatial transcriptomics: tissue context for expression
- Spatial foundation models: emerging approaches
- Limitations: resolution, population averaging, causality

**Pedagogical arc**:
1. Open with the folding problem: 2 meters of DNA in a 10 micron nucleus
2. Explain chromatin organization levels
3. Introduce Hi-C and what it measures
4. Cover sequence → 3D structure prediction models
5. Connect 3D structure to regulatory models from Ch 13
6. Introduce spatial transcriptomics as tissue-level context
7. Survey emerging spatial foundation models
8. Close with: 3D structure is the missing link between sequence and regulation

**Connections**:
- Back to Ch 13 (what Enformer is missing: 3D context)
- Forward to Ch 18 (chromatin contacts as edges in networks)
- Forward to Ch 19 (multi-omics includes spatial data)
- Forward to Ch 24 (interpreting predictions through 3D structure)

**Content sources**: This is new content. Draw on: Akita [@fudenberg_predicting_2020], Orca, C.Origami papers, recent spatial transcriptomics FMs.
