# Soft Landings Reference

Quick reference for chapter ending requirements.

## Philosophy

End chapters when the argument naturally completes. NOT a summary—closure that opens toward what comes next. Readers should feel the chapter resolved its central tension while understanding how that resolution creates new questions.

## Forbidden Headings

- "Summary"
- "Conclusion" / "Conclusions"
- "Looking Forward"
- "Future Directions"
- "Chapter Summary"

## Required: Tension-Based Headings

The heading should be quotable—a one-phrase summary of what the chapter revealed:

| Chapter Type | Example Headings |
|--------------|------------------|
| Methodology | "Necessary but Insufficient" |
| Model family | "Representations Without Predictions" |
| Clinical | "The Interpretive Partnership" |
| Evaluation | "Plausibility Is Not Faithfulness" |
| Application | "Tools for Interpretation, Not Oracles" |

## Three-Beat Structure (2-3 paragraphs)

### Beat 1: What This Chapter Established
- Name the paradigm, capability, or insight
- State positively but without false enthusiasm
- Ground in concrete examples

### Beat 2: What It Cannot Do
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- "Reasons for rigor, not despair"
- Integrate naturally, don't append as disclaimers

### Beat 3: How It Connects Forward
- Connect through ideas, not enumeration
- 2-3 forward references maximum, woven naturally
- Final sentence: memorable, frames larger arc

## Patterns That Work

**"Necessary but Insufficient"** (methodology chapters):
> "Yet uncertainty quantification alone is insufficient. A perfectly calibrated black box remains a black box."

**"Partnership, Not Replacement"** (clinical chapters):
> "Foundation models do not replace human judgment... The productive framing positions foundation models as partners."

**"Complementary Tools"** (model family chapters):
> "DNA language models produce representations, not predictions... These limitations define the complementary relationship."

## What to Avoid

**Enumerated forward references:**
- ❌ "@sec-dna-lm covers DNA language models. @sec-protein-lm addresses protein models."
- ✅ "The DNA language models in @sec-dna-lm and protein language models in @sec-protein-lm each employ variants..."

**More than 2-3 @sec references**

**Lists disguised as prose:**
- ❌ "This chapter covered: first, X; second, Y; third, Z."

**Meta-commentary:**
- ❌ "This chapter established..."
- ❌ "We have examined..."

**Preview-style endings:**
- ❌ "The next chapter examines..."

**Bold text for emphasis in soft landings**

## Memorable Final Sentence Characteristics

- States a tension or relationship, not just a fact
- Uses parallel structure where appropriate
- Connects specific chapter to broader stakes
- Avoids false enthusiasm
- Could stand alone as an insight

**Examples:**
- "Neither alone suffices; together they provide the foundation for models that clinicians can reason with rather than merely defer to."
- "The human systems that govern their development and deployment will determine whether those capabilities translate into genuine benefit."

## Checklist

Before finalizing any soft landing:
- [ ] Is the heading tension-based, not generic?
- [ ] Does paragraph 1 name what established without meta-commentary?
- [ ] Does paragraph 2 acknowledge limitations honestly?
- [ ] Are forward references limited to 2-3 and woven into argument?
- [ ] Does the final sentence feel memorable and quotable?
- [ ] Did I avoid enumerated chapter references?
- [ ] Did I avoid bold text for emphasis?
