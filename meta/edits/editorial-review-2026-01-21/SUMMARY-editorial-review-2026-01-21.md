## Common Issues Across Chapters

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. **Em-dashes**: Found in multiple chapters - zero tolerance rule violated
2. **Missing citations**: Several [Citation Needed] markers remain
3. **Citation key mismatches**: Some bibliography keys don't match

### High Priority
1. **"However" overuse**: Vary transitions in several chapters
2. **"Notably" transitions**: Remove or replace
3. **Verify 2025 preprints**: Check status before publication

### Style Patterns
- **Prose Quality**: Generally clean, low AI probability across most chapters
- **Pedagogical Structure**: Consistently strong (most chapters grade A)
- **Mathematical Presentation**: Well-formatted equations throughout

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Global search for em-dashes (`—` or `---`) and replace
2. Resolve all `[Citation Needed]` markers
3. Verify all citation keys match bibliography

### Before Publication
1. Address all "Needs Work" chapters (App D, App F, App G)
2. Review Part 7 chapters for consistency
3. Final proofread of Part 5 (Ch19, Ch21)

### Strengths to Preserve
- Strong pedagogical scaffolding throughout
- Authentic author voice in preface
- Clean, professional prose in most chapters
- Excellent use of callouts, examples, and knowledge checks
