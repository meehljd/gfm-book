## Term Coverage

### Terms by Domain Tag

| Domain | Count | Example Terms |
|--------|------:|---------------|
| [ML] | 62 | Foundation model, Transformer, Embedding |
| [Genomics] | 54 | GWAS, eQTL, TAD, Enhancer |
| [Clinical] | 38 | VUS, ACMG, Calibration, PRS |
| [Statistics] | 31 | Calibration, AUROC, Batch effect |
| [Computation] | 12 | VCF, BAM, FASTQ, GATK |

**Note**: Some terms have multiple tags (not counted separately).

## Missing Terms (from callout)

The glossary file contains a callout marking these terms as needing addition:

| Term | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Hazard ratio | High | Used in survival analysis (Ch25) |
| Incidence curve | Medium | Risk prediction context |
| Liability scale | Medium | PGS context (Ch3, Ch25) |
| Gain-of-function mutations | High | Discussed in VEP chapters |
| Dominant-negative effects | Medium | Protein mutation effects |
| Loss-of-function | High | Frequently referenced concept |
| Haploinsufficiency | Medium | Gene dosage effects |

**Action**: These 7 terms should be added to the glossary.

## Spelling/Formatting Inconsistencies

### Hyphenation Issues

| Term | Glossary Form | Main Text Form | Occurrences |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| pretraining | pre-train | pretrain | 272 vs 5 |
| finetuning | fine-tuning | finetun* | 109 vs 7 |

**Recommendation**: Standardize to the more common form used in main text:
- Use "pretraining" / "pretrained" (no hyphen)
- Use "fine-tuning" / "fine-tuned" (hyphenated) - already dominant

### Duplicate Definitions

| Term | Issue |
|------|-------|
| Linkage disequilibrium (LD) | Defined twice (line 290 and 292) with [Genomics] and [Statistics] tags |
| PRS / PGS | Three separate entries - consider consolidating |
| TAD | Defined twice (line 460 and 476) |

**Recommendation**: Merge duplicate entries, use multiple domain tags on single entry.

## Potentially Unused Terms

Terms defined in glossary but rarely or never found in main chapter text:

| Term | Glossary | Main Text | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| AUPRC | Defined | 0 uses outside glossary | **UNUSED** |
| BLEU | Not defined | 0 uses | OK (not relevant) |
| MAE | Not defined | 0 uses | OK (not used) |
| MSE | Not defined | 0 uses | OK (not used) |
| Perplexity | Not defined | 1 use | Consider adding |

**Note**: AUPRC is a relevant evaluation metric that should be used in evaluation chapters (Ch20, Ch21). Either add usage or note it's for reference.

## High-Frequency Terms (properly defined)

| Term | Uses | Status |
|------|-----:|--------|
| Foundation model | 414 | ✓ Defined |
| Embedding | 284 | ✓ Defined |
| Pretrain* | 272 | ✓ Defined |
| Transformer | 195 | ✓ Defined |
| Pathogenic | 164 | ✓ Defined |
| GWAS | 124 | ✓ Defined |
| Fine-tun* | 109 | ✓ Defined |
| Convolution* | 94 | ✓ Defined |
| Tokeniz* | 87 | ✓ Defined |
| Enformer | 79 | Not defined (model name) |
| Chromatin accessibility | 72 | ✓ Defined |

## Abbreviation Coverage

| Abbreviation | Expansion in Glossary | Uses in Text |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| GWAS | ✓ Genome-wide association study | 124 |
| PGS | ✓ Polygenic score | 47 |
| VUS | ✓ Variant of uncertain significance | 30 |
| TAD | ✓ Topologically associating domain | 26 |
| SNP | ✓ Single nucleotide polymorphism | 19 |
| LoRA | ✓ Low-Rank Adaptation | 19 |
| MLM | ✓ Masked language modeling | 37 |
| BPE | Not defined | 28 |
| AUROC | ✓ Area under ROC curve | 2 |

**Missing abbreviation**: BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) used 28 times but not in glossary. Consider adding.

## Model Names (Not Defined - Intentional)

These model names are frequently used but appropriately not in glossary:

| Model | Uses | Notes |
|-------|-----:|-------|
| Enformer | 79 | Covered in Ch13 |
| AlphaMissense | 42 | Covered in Ch14 |
| DNABERT | Various | Covered in Ch11 |
| HyenaDNA | Various | Covered in Ch11 |
| ESM-2 | Various | Covered in Ch12 |

**Status**: OK - Model details belong in chapters, not glossary.

## Cross-Domain Term Clarity

Terms that bridge multiple domains and might cause confusion:

| Term | Domains | Clarity Status |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Calibration | [Statistics] + [Clinical] | ✓ Well-defined |
| Batch effect | [Statistics] | ✓ Clear |
| Coverage | [Genomics] + [Statistics] | ✓ Two separate entries |
| Dropout | [ML] (not defined) vs [Statistics] | Only single-cell dropout defined |

**Potential Issue**: ML "dropout" (regularization technique) not defined, but used in Ch6-8. Single-cell dropout is defined.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Add 7 pending terms** from callout:
   - Hazard ratio, Incidence curve, Liability scale
   - Gain-of-function, Dominant-negative, Loss-of-function, Haploinsufficiency

2. **Fix duplicate entries**:
   - Merge two "Linkage disequilibrium" entries
   - Merge two "TAD" entries
   - Consider consolidating PRS/PGS entries

3. **Add missing abbreviation**:
   - BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) - 28 uses in text

### Medium Priority

4. **Standardize hyphenation**:
   - Update glossary "pre-train" → "pretrain" to match text

5. **Add ML dropout definition**:
   - Neural network regularization technique (distinct from single-cell dropout)

6. **Review AUPRC usage**:
   - Either add usage in evaluation chapters or note it's for reference

### Low Priority

7. **Consider adding**:
   - Perplexity (1 use, relevant to LM evaluation)
   - Additional model evaluation metrics if used

## Glossary Health Score

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Core terms coverage | 95% (well-covered) |
| Abbreviation coverage | 90% (BPE missing) |
| Domain balance | Good (ML and Genomics strongest) |
| Duplicate entries | 2-3 need merging |
| Pending additions | 7 terms in callout |
| Spelling consistency | 1 issue (pretrain) |
| **Overall** | **Good - minor cleanup needed** |

## Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Find pretrain/pre-train inconsistencies
grep -rn "pre-train" part_*/*.qmd appendix/*.qmd

# Find duplicate glossary definitions
grep -n "^\*\*" appendix/app-f-glossary.qmd | sort -t: -k2 | uniq -d

# Find BPE usage to understand context
grep -rn "\bBPE\b" part_*/*.qmd
```
