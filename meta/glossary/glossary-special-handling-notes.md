# Glossary terms needing special handling (review list)

These terms are commonly explained in-line, branded resources/datasets, or items where consistency matters (e.g., whether to glossary-define vs reference in text).

**Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** [ML]: A data-driven tokenization method that iteratively merges frequent symbol pairs to form a subword vocabulary. Balances vocabulary size and sequence length; see also: **token**, **vocabulary**.

**CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion)** [ML]: A widely used variant prioritization score that integrates diverse genomic annotations to estimate how deleterious a variant is likely to be. Trained using an evolutionary proxy task contrasting simulated variants with variants observed in humans.

**ClinVar** [Clinical]: A public archive of variant interpretations and supporting evidence linking genetic variants to clinical phenotypes. Widely used in clinical variant interpretation and to label variants for benchmarking.

**gnomAD** [Genomics]: A large population reference database of human genetic variation and allele frequencies. Commonly used to filter variants by population frequency and to provide evidence against pathogenicity for very common alleles.

**GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression)** [Genomics]: A consortium resource linking genetic variation to gene expression across many human tissues. Central for **eQTL** discovery and interpreting regulatory variants.

**UK Biobank** [Genomics]: A large population cohort with genotypes, phenotypes, and health records used extensively for GWAS and polygenic score development. Illustrates both the scale and the bias/ancestry challenges in modern genetics.
