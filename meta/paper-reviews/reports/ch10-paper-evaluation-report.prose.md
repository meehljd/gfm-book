### avsec_enformer_2021

[Enformer] Effective gene expression prediction from sequence by integrating long-range interactions — Avsec, Žiga and Agarwal, Vikram and Visentin, D. and Ledsam, J. and Grabska-Barwinska, A. and Taylor, Kyle R. and Assael, Yannis and Jumper, J. and Kohli, Pushmeet and Kelley, David R. — Nature Methods (2021) — DOI: 10.1038/s41592-021-01252-x — URL: https://consensus.app/papers/effective-gene-expression-prediction-from-sequence-by-avsec-agarwal/6afb944129f35bad916e6f4a889c07cb/

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is mid-era work (year 2021) that often serves as a bridge between early deep learning for sequences and modern foundation models.

**Venue signal.** The venue given in the BibTeX entry is Nature Methods. This is generally a credible signal, but final confidence depends on confirming the version-of-record (especially if the entry is a preprint).

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 2.** This line of work commonly provides sufficient methodological detail and/or some artifacts (code, models, or datasets), but this should be confirmed in the PDF and associated repositories.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 2.** Validation is likely reasonably rigorous (multiple benchmarks or tasks), though the independence of test sets should be verified.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper likely supports a core concept, model family, benchmark, or deployment-relevant application that the textbook should teach explicitly.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: moderate. Recommend adding a short boxed example/figure plus a citation, and referencing it in the relevant chapter narrative.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Likely to remain relevant (‘textbook test’ passes).

**PDF availability.** Publisher PDF via DOI (may be paywalled).

**Recommendation.** INCLUDE. Suggested book location: Ch10 (genomic sequence modeling).

### hoffmann_chinchilla_2022

An empirical analysis of compute-optimal large language model training — (2022)

**Scope fit.** Scope fit is unclear from the BibTeX metadata alone; the title/venue do not unambiguously signal deep learning over genomic or protein sequences.

**Recency relevance.** This is recent/modern work (year 2022), aligned with current genomic foundation-model approaches.

**Venue signal.** The BibTeX entry does not specify a venue (journal/conference). This weakens venue signal until a version-of-record is confirmed.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 1.** Reproducibility is unclear from the citation metadata; assume methods-only unless the PDF provides code/data/weights.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 1.** Validation is likely limited (e.g., single benchmark or closely related datasets), pending PDF verification.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper is useful as supporting/background material rather than a centerpiece.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: low. A brief citation (and possibly a one-sentence pointer) is usually sufficient.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Longevity uncertain; adoption and replication should be monitored.

[GROVER] DNA language model GROVER learns sequence context in the human genome — Sanabria, Melissa and Hirsch, Jonas and Joubert, Pierre M. and Poetsch, Anna R. — Nature Machine Intelligence (2024) — DOI: 10.1038/s42256-024-00872-0 — URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00872-0

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is recent/modern work (year 2024), aligned with current genomic foundation-model approaches.

**Venue signal.** The venue given in the BibTeX entry is Nature Machine Intelligence. This is generally a credible signal, but final confidence depends on confirming the version-of-record (especially if the entry is a preprint).

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 2.** This line of work commonly provides sufficient methodological detail and/or some artifacts (code, models, or datasets), but this should be confirmed in the PDF and associated repositories.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 2.** Validation is likely reasonably rigorous (multiple benchmarks or tasks), though the independence of test sets should be verified.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper likely supports a core concept, model family, benchmark, or deployment-relevant application that the textbook should teach explicitly.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: moderate. Recommend adding a short boxed example/figure plus a citation, and referencing it in the relevant chapter narrative.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Longevity uncertain; adoption and replication should be monitored.

**PDF availability.** Publisher PDF via DOI (may be paywalled).

**Recommendation.** INCLUDE. Suggested book location: Ch10 (genomic sequence modeling).

### zhou_deepsea_2015

[DeepSEA] Predicting effects of noncoding variants with deep learning–based sequence model — Zhou, Jian and Troyanskaya, Olga G. — Nature Methods (2015) — DOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3547 — URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3547

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is a foundational paper (year 2015) that remains influential and is still commonly cited in modern foundation-model practice.

**Venue signal.** The venue given in the BibTeX entry is Nature Methods. This is generally a credible signal, but final confidence depends on confirming the version-of-record (especially if the entry is a preprint).

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.
