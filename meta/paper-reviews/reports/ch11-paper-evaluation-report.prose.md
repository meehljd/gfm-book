### benegas_gpn_2023

[GPN] DNA language models are powerful predictors of genome-wide variant effects — Benegas, Gonzalo and Batra, Sanjit Singh and Song, Yun S. — Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023) — DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2311219120 — URL: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311219120

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is recent/modern work (year 2023), aligned with current genomic foundation-model approaches.

**Venue signal.** The venue given in the BibTeX entry is Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This is generally a credible signal, but final confidence depends on confirming the version-of-record (especially if the entry is a preprint).

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 2.** This line of work commonly provides sufficient methodological detail and/or some artifacts (code, models, or datasets), but this should be confirmed in the PDF and associated repositories.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 2.** Validation is likely reasonably rigorous (multiple benchmarks or tasks), though the independence of test sets should be verified.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper likely supports a core concept, model family, benchmark, or deployment-relevant application that the textbook should teach explicitly.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: moderate. Recommend adding a short boxed example/figure plus a citation, and referencing it in the relevant chapter narrative.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Likely to remain relevant (‘textbook test’ passes).

**PDF availability.** Publisher PDF via DOI (may be paywalled).

**Recommendation.** INCLUDE. Suggested book location: Ch11 (genomic sequence modeling).

**Reproducibility (0–3): 3.** This work is widely used with strong reproducibility signals (code and/or model weights and clear usage instructions are typically available).

**Validation rigor (0–3): 1.** Validation is likely limited (e.g., single benchmark or closely related datasets), pending PDF verification.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This work is promising but still unsettled (preprint/new results); it may become core if it holds up and gets adopted.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: low-to-moderate as a sidebar ‘emerging direction’ citation, pending re-evaluation.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Longevity uncertain; adoption and replication should be monitored.

**PDF availability.** Likely public PDF via preprint server.

**Recommendation.** MONITOR. Suggested book location: Ch11 (genomic sequence modeling).
