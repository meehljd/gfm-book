### camillo_cpgpt_2024

CpGPT: a Foundation Model for DNA Methylation — Camillo, Lucas Paulo de Lima and Sehgal, Raghav and Armstrong, Jenel and Higgins-Chen, Albert T. and Horvath, Steve and Wang, Bo — bioRxiv (2024) — DOI: 10.1101/2024.10.24.619766 — URL: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.24.619766v1

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is recent/modern work (year 2024), aligned with current genomic foundation-model approaches.

**Venue signal.** The BibTeX entry does not specify a venue (journal/conference). This weakens venue signal until a version-of-record is confirmed.

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 2.** This line of work commonly provides sufficient methodological detail and/or some artifacts (code, models, or datasets), but this should be confirmed in the PDF and associated repositories.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 2.** Validation is likely reasonably rigorous (multiple benchmarks or tasks), though the independence of test sets should be verified.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This work is promising but still unsettled (preprint/new results); it may become core if it holds up and gets adopted.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: low-to-moderate as a sidebar ‘emerging direction’ citation, pending re-evaluation.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Longevity uncertain; adoption and replication should be monitored.

**PDF availability.** Likely public PDF via preprint server.

**Recommendation.** MONITOR. Suggested book location: Ch16 (genomic sequence modeling).

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is recent/modern work (year 2022), aligned with current genomic foundation-model approaches.

**Venue signal.** The venue given in the BibTeX entry is Nature Biotechnology. This is generally a credible signal, but final confidence depends on confirming the version-of-record (especially if the entry is a preprint).

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 2.** Validation is likely reasonably rigorous (multiple benchmarks or tasks), though the independence of test sets should be verified.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper likely supports a core concept, model family, benchmark, or deployment-relevant application that the textbook should teach explicitly.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: moderate. Recommend adding a short boxed example/figure plus a citation, and referencing it in the relevant chapter narrative.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Likely to remain relevant (‘textbook test’ passes).

**PDF availability.** Publisher PDF via DOI (may be paywalled).

**Recommendation.** INCLUDE. Suggested book location: Ch16 (genomic sequence modeling).

### dixit_perturb-seq_2016

Missing reference for dixit_perturb-seq_2016

**Scope fit.** Scope fit is unclear from the BibTeX metadata alone; the title/venue do not unambiguously signal deep learning over genomic or protein sequences.

**Recency relevance.** The year is missing in the BibTeX metadata; recency relevance cannot be assessed reliably until the correct citation is resolved.

**Venue signal.** The BibTeX entry does not specify a venue (journal/conference). This weakens venue signal until a version-of-record is confirmed.

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 1.** Reproducibility is unclear from the citation metadata; assume methods-only unless the PDF provides code/data/weights.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 1.** Validation is likely limited (e.g., single benchmark or closely related datasets), pending PDF verification.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper is useful as supporting/background material rather than a centerpiece.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: low. A brief citation (and possibly a one-sentence pointer) is usually sufficient.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Longevity uncertain; adoption and replication should be monitored.

**PDF availability.** PDF not identifiable from BibTeX metadata.

**Recommendation.** CITED. Suggested book location: Ch16.
