## dauparas_proteinmpnn_2022

**Title:** Robust deep learning–based protein sequence design using ProteinMPNN


**First author / year / venue:** Dauparas / 2022 / Science


**Where it appears in the chapter:** Chapter 28: Design — Structure-aware design with diffusion models


**Publication status:** not checked beyond metadata (assume published if venue is a journal/conference; otherwise treat as preprint).


### 30-Second Triage (Gates)

- **Scope fit (DL + genomics sequences/variants/regulation, or (for this part) biomolecular design):** YES. 
This appears within the book’s scope for this chapter.

- **Recency relevance:** modern (based on year 2022).

- **Venue signal:** YES. 
Preprint status increases the durability bar.


### Tier 1: Red Flags (Immediate Disqualification)

I did not run a full PDF-level audit for leakage/overlap, and most chapters’ Quarto text does not include the methodological details needed to verify held-out evaluation rigor. 
So: **no hard red flags were confirmed from the chapter text alone**; any high-stakes claims should still be verified in the paper PDF (train/test splits, external validation, baselines, ablations, and confounder controls).


### Tier 2: Quality Scoring

- **Reproducibility (0–3):** 3. 
There is public code and/or packaging for reproduction (per web check for major items), but confirm exact data/weights access in the PDF or repo.

- **Validation rigor (0–3):** 1. 
Evidence suggests standard held-out evaluation and/or multiple benchmarks, but truly independent external validation is unclear.

- **Claim calibration:** OK. 
Claims appear broadly commensurate with typical evidence for the venue/category.


### Tier 3: Book Relevance

- **Gap filled / role in chapter:** This citation supports the section “Structure-aware design with diffusion models” (per chapter structure) and can serve as an example or canonical reference for the concept discussed there.

- **Integration cost:** 
Low-to-medium: likely a drop-in citation plus (optionally) a short boxed example/figure callout, depending on how central the paper is to the section.

- **Pedagogical value:** M. 
Good supporting example; probably not worth a long deep-dive unless it’s central.


### Tier 4: Longevity (“Textbook Test”)

- **Longevity:** +. 
Likely to remain a standard reference for the concept or method family.


### Recommendation

- **Status:** INCLUDE

- **Integration note:** consider adding a short “why it matters” paragraph + pointer to code/resources.

## deboer_deciphering_2020

**Title:** Deciphering eukaryotic gene-regulatory logic with 100 million random promoters


**First author / year / venue:** de Boer / 2020 / Nature Biotechnology


**Where it appears in the chapter:** Chapter 28: Design — Promoter and enhancer engineering


**Publication status:** not checked beyond metadata (assume published if venue is a journal/conference; otherwise treat as preprint).


### 30-Second Triage (Gates)

- **Scope fit (DL + genomics sequences/variants/regulation, or (for this part) biomolecular design):** YES. 
This appears within the book’s scope for this chapter.

- **Recency relevance:** foundational (based on year 2020).

- **Venue signal:** YES. 
Preprint status increases the durability bar.


### Tier 1: Red Flags (Immediate Disqualification)

I did not run a full PDF-level audit for leakage/overlap, and most chapters’ Quarto text does not include the methodological details needed to verify held-out evaluation rigor. 
So: **no hard red flags were confirmed from the chapter text alone**; any high-stakes claims should still be verified in the paper PDF (train/test splits, external validation, baselines, ablations, and confounder controls).


### Tier 2: Quality Scoring

- **Reproducibility (0–3):** 1. 
No clear code/weights link was confirmed in the quick check; treat as harder to reproduce.

- **Validation rigor (0–3):** 1. 
Evidence suggests standard held-out evaluation and/or multiple benchmarks, but truly independent external validation is unclear.

- **Claim calibration:** OK. 
Claims appear broadly commensurate with typical evidence for the venue/category.


### Tier 3: Book Relevance

- **Gap filled / role in chapter:** This citation supports the section “Promoter and enhancer engineering” (per chapter structure) and can serve as an example or canonical reference for the concept discussed there.

- **Integration cost:** 
Low-to-medium: likely a drop-in citation plus (optionally) a short boxed example/figure callout, depending on how central the paper is to the section.

- **Pedagogical value:** L. 
Useful as a pointer, but limited as a teaching vehicle.


### Tier 4: Longevity (“Textbook Test”)

- **Longevity:** ?. 
May be superseded; keep if it uniquely illustrates a principle or is heavily adopted.


### Recommendation

- **Status:** CITED

- **Integration note:** keep as supporting citation; avoid leaning on it for the chapter’s main empirical claims.
