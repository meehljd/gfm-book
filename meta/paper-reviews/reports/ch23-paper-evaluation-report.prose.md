### fowler_deep_2014

TODO — TODO — (TODO)

**Scope fit.** Scope fit is unclear from the BibTeX metadata alone; the title/venue do not unambiguously signal deep learning over genomic or protein sequences.

**Recency relevance.** The year is missing in the BibTeX metadata; recency relevance cannot be assessed reliably until the correct citation is resolved.

**Venue signal.** The BibTeX entry does not specify a venue (journal/conference). This weakens venue signal until a version-of-record is confirmed.

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 1.** Reproducibility is unclear from the citation metadata; assume methods-only unless the PDF provides code/data/weights.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 1.** Validation is likely limited (e.g., single benchmark or closely related datasets), pending PDF verification.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper is useful as supporting/background material rather than a centerpiece.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: low. A brief citation (and possibly a one-sentence pointer) is usually sufficient.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Longevity uncertain; adoption and replication should be monitored.

**PDF availability.** PDF not identifiable from BibTeX metadata.

**Recommendation.** CITED. Suggested book location: Ch23.

### guo_calibration_2017

**Scope fit.** Scope fit is unclear from the BibTeX metadata alone; the title/venue do not unambiguously signal deep learning over genomic or protein sequences.

**Recency relevance.** The year is missing in the BibTeX metadata; recency relevance cannot be assessed reliably until the correct citation is resolved.

**Venue signal.** The BibTeX entry does not specify a venue (journal/conference). This weakens venue signal until a version-of-record is confirmed.

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 3.** This work is widely used with strong reproducibility signals (code and/or model weights and clear usage instructions are typically available).

**Validation rigor (0–3): 2.** Validation is likely reasonably rigorous (multiple benchmarks or tasks), though the independence of test sets should be verified.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper is useful as supporting/background material rather than a centerpiece.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: low. A brief citation (and possibly a one-sentence pointer) is usually sufficient.

**Pedagogical value.** High pedagogical value: clean principle or widely-reused method with teachable examples/figures.

**Longevity.** Likely to remain relevant (‘textbook test’ passes).

**PDF availability.** PDF not identifiable from BibTeX metadata.

**Recommendation.** CITED. Suggested book location: Ch23.

### landrum_clinvar_2018

ClinVar: improving access to variant interpretations and supporting evidence — Landrum, Melissa J and Lee, Jennifer M and Benson, Mark and Brown, Garth R and Chao, Chen and Chitipiralla, Shanmuga and Gu, Baoshan and Hart, Jennifer and Hoffman, Douglas and Jang, Wonhee and Karapetyan, Karen and Katz, Kenneth and Liu, Chunlei and Maddipatla, Zenith and Malheiro, Adriana and McDaniel, Kurt and Ovetsky, Michael and Riley, George and Zhou, George and Holmes, J Bradley and Kattman, Brandi L and Maglott, Donna R — Nucleic Acids Research (2018) — DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkx1153 — URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1153

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is a foundational paper (year 2018) that remains influential and is still commonly cited in modern foundation-model practice.

**Venue signal.** The venue given in the BibTeX entry is Nucleic Acids Research. This is generally a credible signal, but final confidence depends on confirming the version-of-record (especially if the entry is a preprint).

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 2.** This line of work commonly provides sufficient methodological detail and/or some artifacts (code, models, or datasets), but this should be confirmed in the PDF and associated repositories.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 2.** Validation is likely reasonably rigorous (multiple benchmarks or tasks), though the independence of test sets should be verified.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper likely supports a core concept, model family, benchmark, or deployment-relevant application that the textbook should teach explicitly.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: moderate. Recommend adding a short boxed example/figure plus a citation, and referencing it in the relevant chapter narrative.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Likely to remain relevant (‘textbook test’ passes).

**PDF availability.** Publisher PDF via DOI (may be paywalled).

**Recommendation.** INCLUDE. Suggested book location: Ch23 (genomic sequence modeling).
