## Per-paper evaluations

### @choi_prs_2020

**Bibliographic anchor.** *[{PRS}] {Tutorial}: a guide to performing polygenic risk score analyses* (2020; Nature Protocols).

**Scope fit.** Scope fit is supportive: this work defines evaluation practice, calibration, or benchmarking. It is essential scaffolding even when the contribution is not a new deep model.

**Recency relevance.** Recency relevance is acceptable: it represents established practice that is still directly used or cited in modern pipelines.

**Venue signal.** Venue signal is strong: it is published in a reputable journal or conference and has clear provenance.

**Tier 1 red-flags check.** Based on the citation context and the paper’s role (method, resource, or benchmark), there are no obvious immediate red flags like missing evaluation, but a full read should still confirm held-out testing, leakage control, and appropriate baselines when the paper is used for performance claims.

**Reproducibility (score 2).** Moderate reproducibility signal: methods are usually clear and there is often code or an established implementation, but full end-to-end re-running may require additional effort or data access.

**Validation rigor (score 3).** Strong validation signal: results are typically supported across multiple independent datasets, cohorts, or orthogonal truth sets, often with careful stratification or error analysis.

**Claim calibration.** Claims appear calibrated to the evidence as cited in the chapter.

**Book relevance and integration.** In the manuscript, this citation supports **Ch03-PRSandPopulationStructure**. Integration cost is low because it is already positioned as a reference point in that section.

**Pedagogical value (M).** Moderate pedagogical value: it is useful for context and as a reference, but it may not be the clearest teaching vehicle on its own.

**Longevity (?).** Longevity outlook is uncertain: likely useful now, but may be superseded or depends on current benchmarks and tooling.

**Framework decision.** Decision: INCLUDE as a durable anchor for the chapter section noted below.

### @yang_common_2010

**Bibliographic anchor.** *Common {SNPs} explain a large proportion of the heritability for human height* (2010; Nature Genetics).

**Scope fit.** Scope fit is supportive: this is statistical genetics methodology and is relevant for interpreting model outputs and downstream genetic inference.

**Recency relevance.** Recency relevance is strong in the ‘foundational’ sense: although older, it remains influential and is still commonly cited or used.

**Venue signal.** Venue signal is strong: it is published in a reputable journal or conference and has clear provenance.

**Tier 1 red-flags check.** Based on the citation context and the paper’s role (method, resource, or benchmark), there are no obvious immediate red flags like missing evaluation, but a full read should still confirm held-out testing, leakage control, and appropriate baselines when the paper is used for performance claims.

**Reproducibility (score 2).** Moderate reproducibility signal: methods are usually clear and there is often code or an established implementation, but full end-to-end re-running may require additional effort or data access.

**Validation rigor (score 3).** Strong validation signal: results are typically supported across multiple independent datasets, cohorts, or orthogonal truth sets, often with careful stratification or error analysis.

**Claim calibration.** Claims appear calibrated to the evidence as cited in the chapter.

**Book relevance and integration.** In the manuscript, this citation supports **Ch03-PRS**. Integration cost is low because it is already positioned as a reference point in that section.

**Pedagogical value (M).** Moderate pedagogical value: it is useful for context and as a reference, but it may not be the clearest teaching vehicle on its own.

**Longevity (+).** Longevity outlook is positive: likely to remain a standard reference or durable exemplar through 2030.

**Framework decision.** Decision: INCLUDE as a durable anchor for the chapter section noted below.

### @yengo_meta-analysis_2022

**Bibliographic anchor.** *A saturated map of common genetic variants associated with human height* (2022; Nature).

**Scope fit.** Scope fit is partial: it is cited for context but is not central to deep learning on genomic sequence.

**Recency relevance.** Recency relevance is strong because it reflects current practice and datasets (2022 or later).

**Venue signal.** Venue signal is strong: it is published in a reputable journal or conference and has clear provenance.

**Tier 1 red-flags check.** Based on the citation context and the paper’s role (method, resource, or benchmark), there are no obvious immediate red flags like missing evaluation, but a full read should still confirm held-out testing, leakage control, and appropriate baselines when the paper is used for performance claims.

**Reproducibility (score 2).** Moderate reproducibility signal: methods are usually clear and there is often code or an established implementation, but full end-to-end re-running may require additional effort or data access.

**Validation rigor (score 2).** Moderate validation signal: evaluation is usually present and reasonably broad, but independence across cohorts or prospective validation may be limited.

**Claim calibration.** Claims appear calibrated to the evidence as cited in the chapter.

**Book relevance and integration.** In the manuscript, this citation supports **Ch03-PRS**. Integration cost is low because it is already positioned as a reference point in that section.

**Pedagogical value (M).** Moderate pedagogical value: it is useful for context and as a reference, but it may not be the clearest teaching vehicle on its own.

**Longevity (?).** Longevity outlook is uncertain: likely useful now, but may be superseded or depends on current benchmarks and tooling.

**Framework decision.** Decision: INCLUDE as a durable anchor for the chapter section noted below.
