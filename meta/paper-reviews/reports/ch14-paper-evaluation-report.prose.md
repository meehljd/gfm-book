### angelopoulos_conformal_2023

A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction and Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification — (2023)

**Scope fit.** This paper is not genomics-specific, but it is relevant background: it introduces or analyzes a general deep learning method (e.g., Transformers, scaling laws, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, or calibration) that is widely reused in genomic foundation models.

**Recency relevance.** This is recent/modern work (year 2023), aligned with current genomic foundation-model approaches.

**Venue signal.** The BibTeX entry does not specify a venue (journal/conference). This weakens venue signal until a version-of-record is confirmed.

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 2.** This line of work commonly provides sufficient methodological detail and/or some artifacts (code, models, or datasets), but this should be confirmed in the PDF and associated repositories.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 1.** Validation is likely limited (e.g., single benchmark or closely related datasets), pending PDF verification.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper is useful as supporting/background material rather than a centerpiece.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: low. A brief citation (and possibly a one-sentence pointer) is usually sufficient.

**Pedagogical value.** Lower pedagogical value: mostly background or incremental, best kept as a citation only.

**Longevity.** Longevity uncertain; adoption and replication should be monitored.

**PDF availability.** PDF not identifiable from BibTeX metadata.

**Recommendation.** CITED. Suggested book location: Ch14 (methods background).

AlphaGenome: AI for better understanding the genome — Avsec, Ziga and Latysheva, Natasha and Cheng, Jun — Google DeepMind (2025) — URL: https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is recent/modern work (year 2025), aligned with current genomic foundation-model approaches.

**Venue signal.** The venue given in the BibTeX entry is Google DeepMind. This is generally a credible signal, but final confidence depends on confirming the version-of-record (especially if the entry is a preprint).

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 1.** Reproducibility is unclear from the citation metadata; assume methods-only unless the PDF provides code/data/weights.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 1.** Validation is likely limited (e.g., single benchmark or closely related datasets), pending PDF verification.

**Claim calibration.** Claims are likely at risk of overreach given the preprint/newness and typical benchmark fragility; treat as promising but unconfirmed until independent replication or a peer-reviewed version.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This work is promising but still unsettled (preprint/new results); it may become core if it holds up and gets adopted.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: low-to-moderate as a sidebar ‘emerging direction’ citation, pending re-evaluation.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Longevity uncertain; adoption and replication should be monitored.
