### avsec_enformer_2021

[Enformer] Effective gene expression prediction from sequence by integrating long-range interactions — Avsec, Žiga and Agarwal, Vikram and Visentin, D. and Ledsam, J. and Grabska-Barwinska, A. and Taylor, Kyle R. and Assael, Yannis and Jumper, J. and Kohli, Pushmeet and Kelley, David R. — Nature Methods (2021) — DOI: 10.1038/s41592-021-01252-x — URL: https://consensus.app/papers/effective-gene-expression-prediction-from-sequence-by-avsec-agarwal/6afb944129f35bad916e6f4a889c07cb/

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is mid-era work (year 2021) that often serves as a bridge between early deep learning for sequences and modern foundation models.

**Venue signal.** The venue given in the BibTeX entry is Nature Methods. This is generally a credible signal, but final confidence depends on confirming the version-of-record (especially if the entry is a preprint).

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 2.** This line of work commonly provides sufficient methodological detail and/or some artifacts (code, models, or datasets), but this should be confirmed in the PDF and associated repositories.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 2.** Validation is likely reasonably rigorous (multiple benchmarks or tasks), though the independence of test sets should be verified.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper likely supports a core concept, model family, benchmark, or deployment-relevant application that the textbook should teach explicitly.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: moderate. Recommend adding a short boxed example/figure plus a citation, and referencing it in the relevant chapter narrative.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Likely to remain relevant (‘textbook test’ passes).

**PDF availability.** Publisher PDF via DOI (may be paywalled).

**Recommendation.** INCLUDE. Suggested book location: Ch07 (genomic sequence modeling).

### zvyagin_genslms_2022

GenSLMs: Genome-scale language models reveal SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics — Zvyagin, Maxim and Brace, Alexander and Hippe, Kyle and Deng, Yuntian and Zhang, Bin and Bohorquez, Cindy Orozco and Clyde, Austin and Kale, Bharat and Perez-Rivera, Danilo and Ma, Heng and Mann, Carla M. and Irvin, Michael and Pauloski, J. Gregory and Ward, Logan and Hayot-Sasson, Valerie and Emani, Murali and Foreman, Sam and Xie, Zhen and Lin, Diangen and Shukla, Maulik and Nie, Weili and Romero, Josh and Dallago, Christian and Vahdat, Arash and Xiao, Chaowei and Gibbs, Thomas and Foster, Ian and Davis, James J. and Papka, Michael E. and Brettin, Thomas and Stevens, Rick and Anandkumar, Anima and Vishwanath, Venkatram and Ramanathan, Arvind — bioRxiv (2022) — DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.10.511571 — URL: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.10.511571v2

**Scope fit.** This work is in-scope for the book: it applies deep learning to biological sequences (genomics), with direct relevance to genomic/protein foundation models or downstream tasks.

**Recency relevance.** This is recent/modern work (year 2022), aligned with current genomic foundation-model approaches.

**Venue signal.** The BibTeX entry does not specify a venue (journal/conference). This weakens venue signal until a version-of-record is confirmed. Preprint/published-status check: Preprint (bioRxiv 2022); no clear journal/conference version found.

**Tier 1 red flags.** No immediate red flags are visible from bibliographic metadata alone. However, the framework’s highest-risk failure modes (data leakage, weak baselines, missing held-out evaluation, circular validation) require checking the paper PDF and supplementary methods.

**Reproducibility (0–3): 2.** This line of work commonly provides sufficient methodological detail and/or some artifacts (code, models, or datasets), but this should be confirmed in the PDF and associated repositories.

**Validation rigor (0–3): 2.** Validation is likely reasonably rigorous (multiple benchmarks or tasks), though the independence of test sets should be verified.

**Claim calibration.** No obvious over-claiming is detectable from the citation metadata alone; confirm by reading the abstract/results to ensure claims match evidence.

**Book relevance (gap filled).** This paper likely supports a core concept, model family, benchmark, or deployment-relevant application that the textbook should teach explicitly.

**Integration cost.** Integration cost: moderate. Recommend adding a short boxed example/figure plus a citation, and referencing it in the relevant chapter narrative.

**Pedagogical value.** Moderate pedagogical value: useful concept, but may require careful framing or simplification.

**Longevity.** Likely to remain relevant (‘textbook test’ passes).

**PDF availability.** Likely public PDF via preprint server.

**Recommendation.** INCLUDE. Suggested book location: Ch07 (genomic sequence modeling).
