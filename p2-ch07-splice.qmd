# Splicing Prediction {#sec-splice}

## The Splicing Challenge

While DeepSEA and ExPecto (@sec-reg; @sec-trans) addressed chromatin state and gene expression, a distinct class of functional variants operates through a different mechanism: disruption of pre-mRNA splicing. The spliceosome achieves remarkable precision, recognizing the correct splice sites among millions of potential candidates in the human transcriptome. Yet the sequence determinants underlying this specificity remained incompletely understood, limiting interpretation of variants that might alter splicing.

The clinical stakes are substantial. As discussed in @sec-ngs, variant calling pipelines identify thousands of variants per exome and millions per genome, but annotation frameworks traditionally focus on coding consequences. Variants affecting splicing outside the canonical GT/AG dinucleotides are systematically underascertained, even though splice-disrupting mutations are a major mechanism of Mendelian disease. The ACMG/AMP guidelines (@sec-data) recognize splicing evidence as supporting pathogenicity, but until recently, computational tools lacked the accuracy to identify cryptic splice variants reliably.

SpliceAI, introduced by Jaganathan et al. in 2019, demonstrated that deep neural networks could learn the sequence rules governing splicing with near-spliceosomal precision [@jaganathan_spliceai_2019]. The model predicts splice site locations directly from pre-mRNA sequence, enabling identification of "cryptic splice" variants that create novel splice sites or disrupt existing ones in ways that evade traditional annotation-based detection.

This chapter examines SpliceAI as the culmination of Part II's CNN-based sequence-to-function models. Where @sec-reg focused on chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding, and @sec-trans extended to gene expression, SpliceAI targets a specific post-transcriptional mechanism with direct clinical relevance. The model illustrates how deep learning can achieve near-expert performance on a well-defined biological problem while revealing mechanistic insights about the underlying biology.

## Prior Approaches and Limitations

Before SpliceAI, splice site prediction relied on methods with limited sequence context, a constraint we have seen repeatedly limit earlier genomic models (@sec-reg; @sec-trans).

**MaxEntScan** models core splice motifs using maximum entropy, limited to approximately 9 bp context around donor/acceptor sites [@yeo_maxentscan_2004]. **GeneSplicer** combines Markov models with decision trees. **NNSplice** represents an early neural network approach with narrow receptive fields. These methods captured the essential GT (donor) and AG (acceptor) dinucleotides and surrounding consensus sequences, but could not model the long-range determinants that contribute to splicing specificity.

The limitations parallel those of pre-deep-learning variant effect predictors like CADD (@sec-cadd), which aggregate many annotation features but lack the capacity to learn complex sequence dependencies. Just as CADD's logistic regression cannot capture the combinatorial logic of regulatory grammar, MaxEntScan's position weight matrices cannot represent the spatial relationships between distant splicing determinants.

These constraints had practical consequences. Prior methods produced many false positive predictions and missed variants acting through distal mechanisms. A variant that weakens a splice site may only cause pathogenic mis-splicing if no nearby cryptic site can compensate, a judgment requiring integration of information across thousands of nucleotides.

## The SpliceAI Architecture

SpliceAI employs an ultra-deep residual convolutional network that integrates information across 10,000 nucleotides of sequence context. This represents an order of magnitude expansion beyond prior methods and reflects the same architectural intuition that motivated ExPecto's 40 kb regulatory window (@sec-trans): functional genomic predictions often require long-range context that shallow models cannot capture.

### Input Representation

Like DeepSEA and ExPecto, SpliceAI uses one-hot encoded nucleotide sequences as input. The four nucleotides (A, C, G, T) are encoded as binary vectors, with no hand-crafted features or annotations. This end-to-end learning approach forces the network to discover relevant sequence patterns from training data rather than relying on prior biological knowledge.

The input window spans 10,000 nucleotides (5,000 on each side of the position of interest), providing context for recognizing distant determinants like branch points, exonic splicing enhancers, and intron/exon length constraints.

### Residual Block Design

The architecture's fundamental unit is the residual block, comprising batch normalization, ReLU activation, and dilated convolutions. Residual connections address the vanishing gradient problem that had limited earlier deep networks:

$$
\text{output} = \text{input} + F(\text{input})
$$

where $F$ represents the transformation learned by the convolutional layers. This design enables training of networks with 32 layers, far deeper than the 3-layer DeepSEA or 6-layer ExPecto/Beluga architectures (@sec-reg; @sec-trans).

Skip connections from every fourth residual block feed directly to the penultimate layer, accelerating training convergence and enabling gradient flow through the full network depth.

### Dilated Convolutions for Long-Range Context

Standard convolutions with small kernels (e.g., 3-8 bp) would require many layers to achieve a 10,000 bp receptive field, making training prohibitively expensive. SpliceAI uses dilated convolutions that exponentially expand the receptive field while maintaining computational efficiency.

A dilated convolution with dilation rate $d$ samples input positions at intervals of $d$ rather than consecutively. By stacking convolutions with increasing dilation rates, the network can efficiently integrate information across the full 10 kb window while maintaining sensitivity to local motif patterns.

This approach represents an architectural innovation beyond the standard convolutional designs in DeepSEA and ExPecto. Later models in Part III, including long-context transformers and hybrid architectures (@sec-hybrid), would explore alternative solutions to the long-range dependency problem.

### Output Predictions

For each position in the pre-mRNA sequence, SpliceAI outputs three probabilities summing to one: the probability of being a splice acceptor, splice donor, or neither. This per-position classification enables fine-grained predictions across entire transcripts.

## Training and Evaluation

### Training Data

SpliceAI was trained on GENCODE V24 annotations (@sec-data), using 20,287 protein-coding genes with principal transcripts selected when multiple isoforms existed. The training/test split used odd versus even chromosomes:

| Set | Chromosomes | Genes | Donor-Acceptor Pairs |
|-----|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| Training | 2, 4, 6, 8, 10-22, X, Y | 13,384 | 130,796 |
| Testing | 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 | 1,652 | 14,289 |

Critically, genes with paralogs on training chromosomes were excluded from the test set. This prevents information leakage through sequence homology, a form of data leakage we will examine systematically in @sec-confound. Paralog exclusion is particularly important for splicing models because conserved gene families often share splice site architecture.

For variant effect prediction, training was augmented with novel splice junctions commonly observed in GTEx RNA-seq data (@sec-data), adding approximately 67,000 donor and 63,000 acceptor annotations. This augmentation improved sensitivity for detecting splice-altering variants, particularly in deep intronic regions where GENCODE annotations are incomplete.

### Splice Site Prediction Performance

SpliceAI-10k achieved remarkable accuracy:

| Metric | SpliceAI-10k | MaxEntScan |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Top-k accuracy | 95% | 57% |
| PR-AUC | 0.98 | — |

Top-k accuracy measures the fraction of correctly predicted splice sites at the threshold where predicted sites equal actual sites. The dramatic improvement reflects SpliceAI's ability to reject false positive splice sites by considering sequence context beyond the core motif.

Even complex genes exceeding 100 kb, such as CFTR, are often reconstructed perfectly to nucleotide precision. When tested on long noncoding RNAs (which lack protein-coding selective pressures on sequence composition), the network achieved 84% top-k accuracy, confirming it learned genuine splicing determinants rather than artifacts of coding sequence.

### Context Length Matters

Performance improved substantially with context length across SpliceAI variants:

| Model | Context (each side) | Top-k Accuracy | PR-AUC |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|--------|
| SpliceAI-80nt | 40 bp | — | 0.87 |
| SpliceAI-400nt | 200 bp | — | 0.93 |
| SpliceAI-2k | 1,000 bp | — | 0.96 |
| SpliceAI-10k | 5,000 bp | 95% | 0.98 |

This progression confirms that distal sequence features thousands of nucleotides from splice sites contribute meaningfully to splicing decisions. The pattern echoes findings from ExPecto (@sec-trans), where expression prediction improved with wider regulatory windows, and anticipates the even longer contexts explored by transformer models in Part III.

## Variant Effect Prediction

### The Delta Score

SpliceAI predicts variant effects by comparing splice site predictions for reference and alternative sequences:

$$
\Delta\text{score} = \max_{|p - v| \leq 50} \left| P_{\text{alt}}(p) - P_{\text{ref}}(p) \right|
$$

where $v$ is the variant position and $p$ ranges over positions within 50 bp of the variant. The maximum change across all positions captures variants that strengthen existing sites, weaken existing sites, or create entirely new splice sites.

Critically, the model was trained only on reference transcript sequences and splice junction annotations. It never saw variant data during training. Variant effect prediction is thus a challenging test of whether the network learned genuine sequence determinants of splicing, analogous to how ExPecto's variant effect predictions emerged from learning sequence-expression relationships without any variant labels (@sec-trans).

This ab initio approach to variant effect prediction represents a fundamental advantage over annotation-based scores like CADD (@sec-cadd), which incorporate variant-level training data and may learn associations rather than causal sequence-function relationships.

### Cryptic Splice Variant Classes

SpliceAI detects several classes of splice-altering variants:

**Donor/acceptor loss**: Disruption of annotated splice sites, either through direct mutation of the GT/AG dinucleotides or through weakening of flanking enhancer sequences.

**Donor/acceptor gain**: Creation of novel splice sites that compete with canonical sites. These can occur within exons (causing partial exon loss) or within introns (causing inclusion of intronic sequence).

**Exon skipping**: Variants that weaken a splice site sufficiently that the spliceosome skips the entire exon, joining flanking exons directly.

**Intron retention**: Variants causing failure to recognize either the donor or acceptor site of an intron, leaving intronic sequence in mature mRNA.

**Cryptic exon activation**: Deep intronic variants that create both a novel donor and acceptor, activating a "pseudoexon" that inserts into the mature transcript.

Traditional annotation-based methods can identify variants in the essential GT/AG dinucleotides but miss the broader landscape of cryptic splice variants operating through more subtle mechanisms.

### RNA-seq Validation

The authors validated predictions using GTEx RNA-seq data from 149 individuals with matched whole-genome sequencing (@sec-data). Focusing on rare, private mutations (present in only one GTEx individual), they found:

Private mutations predicted to have functional consequences were strongly enriched at private novel splice junctions and at boundaries of skipped exons. Confidently predicted cryptic splice variants (Δ score ≥ 0.5) validated at three-quarters the rate of essential GT/AG splice disruptions.

Both validation rate and effect size tracked closely with Δ scores:

| Δ Score Threshold | Validation Rate |
|------------------|-----------------|
| ≥ 0.2 | ~50% |
| ≥ 0.5 | ~75% |
| ≥ 0.8 | ~85% |

Validated variants, especially those with lower scores, often showed incomplete penetrance, producing a mixture of aberrant and normal transcripts. This partial effect distinguishes cryptic splice variants from essential GT/AG disruptions and has implications for clinical interpretation.

### Population Genetics Evidence

Complementing RNA-seq validation, the authors examined allele frequency spectra in gnomAD (@sec-data). If predicted cryptic splice variants are truly deleterious, they should be depleted at common allele frequencies relative to neutral variants.

Predicted cryptic splice variants (Δ score ≥ 0.8) showed 78% depletion at common frequencies compared to singletons, nearly matching the 82% depletion of frameshift, stop-gain, and essential splice disruptions. This population genetics signature provides orthogonal evidence that predictions identify genuinely functional variants.

The analysis revealed an important nuance: deep intronic variants (>50 nt from exons) showed only 56% depletion, consistent with the lower validation rates observed in RNA-seq data for this category. Predictions farther from annotated exons are more challenging, possibly because deep intronic regions contain fewer of the specificity determinants that have been selected to be present near exons.

### Rare Variant Burden

The average human genome carries approximately:

- **11** rare protein-truncating variants (allele frequency <0.1%)
- **5** rare functional cryptic splice variants

Cryptic splice variants outnumber essential GT/AG splice-disrupting variants roughly 2:1, highlighting the substantial mutational target space beyond canonical splice sites. These numbers provide context for clinical interpretation: cryptic splice variants are not exotic curiosities but a common class of potentially pathogenic variation.

## De Novo Mutations in Rare Disease

The central clinical finding of SpliceAI is that cryptic splice mutations constitute a major, previously underappreciated cause of rare genetic disorders. This analysis connects SpliceAI predictions to the clinical variant interpretation frameworks discussed in @sec-data and previews the pathogenic variant discovery workflows examined in @sec-variants.

### Case-Control Analysis

The authors analyzed de novo mutations in:

- **4,293** individuals with intellectual disability (Deciphering Developmental Disorders cohort)
- **3,953** individuals with autism spectrum disorders (Simons Simplex Collection + Autism Sequencing Consortium)
- **2,073** unaffected sibling controls

De novo mutations predicted to disrupt splicing (Δ ≥ 0.1) were significantly enriched in affected individuals:

| Cohort | Enrichment vs. Controls | p-value |
|--------|------------------------|---------|
| Intellectual disability (DDD) | 1.51-fold | 4.2×10⁻⁴ |
| Autism spectrum disorder | 1.30-fold | 0.020 |

The enrichment remained significant when restricting to synonymous and intronic mutations, excluding the possibility that results were driven solely by variants with dual protein-coding and splicing effects. This confirms that the splicing mechanism itself, not merely correlation with coding effects, drives disease association.

### Fraction of Pathogenic Mutations

Based on the excess of de novo mutations in cases versus controls:

- **9%** of pathogenic de novo mutations in intellectual disability act through cryptic splicing
- **11%** of pathogenic de novo mutations in autism act through cryptic splicing

In absolute terms, approximately 250 cases across the cohorts could be explained by de novo cryptic splice mutations, compared to approximately 909 cases explained by de novo protein-truncating variants.

### Clinical Penetrance

Cryptic splice mutations showed roughly 50% of the clinical penetrance of classic protein-truncating mutations (stop-gain, frameshift, essential splice). This reduced penetrance reflects that many cryptic splice variants are hypomorphic, producing a mixture of normal and aberrant transcripts rather than complete loss of function.

Well-characterized examples from Mendelian disease support this interpretation: the c.315-48T>C variant in FECH and c.-32-13T>G in GAA are both hypomorphic cryptic splice alleles associated with milder phenotype or later age of onset.

The reduced penetrance of cryptic splice mutations has implications for clinical interpretation. Variants with moderate Δ scores may contribute to disease risk without being fully penetrant, and the same variant may have different consequences depending on the expression level and splicing factor context in relevant tissues.

### Novel Gene Discovery

Including cryptic splice mutations in gene discovery analyses identified:

- **5 additional** candidate genes for intellectual disability
- **2 additional** candidate genes for autism

These genes would have fallen below the discovery threshold (FDR <0.01) when considering only protein-coding mutations. This finding suggests that systematic inclusion of splice predictions in gene burden analyses could accelerate discovery of disease genes with splicing-mediated pathogenic mechanisms.

### Experimental Validation

RNA-seq validation in lymphoblastoid cell lines from autism patients confirmed predictions in 21 of 28 cases (75% validation rate). Among confirmed cases:

- 9 showed novel junction creation
- 8 showed exon skipping  
- 4 showed intron retention

Seven cases did not show aberrant splicing in lymphoblastoid cells despite adequate transcript expression. These may represent tissue-specific effects not observable in the available cell type, highlighting a limitation of using accessible tissues for validation.

## What SpliceAI Learned

Beyond prediction accuracy, SpliceAI provides insights into splicing mechanisms through interpretability analyses. These findings demonstrate that deep learning models can serve as hypothesis-generating tools for understanding biology, not merely black-box classifiers.

### Long-Range Specificity Determinants

Comparison of models trained on different context lengths revealed that apparent "degeneracy" in splice motifs (the observation that many sequences matching consensus motifs are not used as splice sites) is explained by long-range determinants:

The 80 bp context model (SpliceAI-80nt) assigned lower scores to splice sites flanking average-length exons and introns, favoring sites adjacent to unusually short or long elements. This reflects that such unusual sites tend to have stronger local motifs to compensate for suboptimal geometry.

The 10 kb context model (SpliceAI-10k) showed the opposite pattern, preferring splice sites flanking typical-length elements. With access to full context, the model learned that typical geometries provide favorable long-range determinants that compensate for weaker local motifs.

This finding resolves a longstanding puzzle in splicing biology: why do most functional splice sites have degenerate motifs when consensus sequences can be much more information-rich? The answer is that motif strength is only one component of recognition; geometric and contextual features provide additional specificity that makes strong motifs unnecessary.

### Branch Point Recognition

In silico mutagenesis experiments confirmed that SpliceAI learned canonical splicing elements without explicit training on them. Introducing the optimal branch point sequence (TACTAAC) at various distances from splice acceptors increased predicted splice strength specifically when placed 20-45 nucleotides upstream, matching the known functional range for branch points in mammals.

At distances less than 20 nucleotides, the branch point sequence disrupted the polypyrimidine tract, decreasing predicted acceptor strength. This context-dependent effect demonstrates that SpliceAI learned the spatial relationships between splicing elements, not just their individual contributions.

### Exonic Splicing Enhancers

The SR-protein binding motif GAAGAA, introduced at various positions, enhanced splice site strength when placed in expected locations within exons. This confirms that SpliceAI learned the contribution of exonic splicing enhancers to splice site recognition.

### Nucleosome Positioning

Novel exon-creation events (where variants activate cryptic exons in introns) were significantly associated with existing nucleosome positioning (p = 0.006 by permutation test), even in cell lines that likely lack the corresponding genetic mutations. This supports a causal role for nucleosome occupancy in exon definition and demonstrates that SpliceAI implicitly captures chromatin-related effects despite not being trained on chromatin data.

The association with nucleosome positioning connects to the chromatin-centric models in @sec-reg and @sec-trans, suggesting that splicing and chromatin state are not independent regulatory layers but interact in ways that sequence models can detect.

## Relationship to Other Sequence-to-Function Models

SpliceAI fits within the broader trajectory of CNN-based genomic models while illustrating the value of task-specific architectures.

### Comparison to DeepSEA and ExPecto

| Feature | DeepSEA | ExPecto | SpliceAI |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Primary task | Chromatin state | Gene expression | Splice sites |
| Context window | 1 kb | 40 kb | 10 kb |
| Architecture depth | 3 layers | 6 layers | 32 layers |
| Output type | Multi-label classification | Regression | Per-position classification |
| Training data | ENCODE/Roadmap | GTEx expression | GENCODE annotations |
| Variant interpretation | Allelic imbalance | Expression effect | Δ score |

SpliceAI shares the one-hot encoding and convolutional architecture of its predecessors but introduces residual connections, dilated convolutions, and much greater depth. These architectural innovations enable effective training on a narrow, well-defined task while achieving substantially higher accuracy than would be possible with shallower networks.

### Task Specificity vs. Foundation Models

SpliceAI represents a different design philosophy from the foundation model approach explored in Parts III and IV. Rather than learning general sequence representations that transfer across tasks, SpliceAI focuses computational capacity on a single problem: predicting splice sites.

This specialization has both advantages and limitations. SpliceAI achieves remarkable accuracy on its target task, but its representations do not obviously transfer to other problems. Later chapters will explore whether self-supervised foundation models can match task-specific performance while providing broader utility (@sec-dna; @sec-princ).

The tension between specialized and general-purpose models remains unresolved. For clinical applications requiring high accuracy on specific tasks, specialized models like SpliceAI may remain preferred. For discovery applications requiring broad coverage of molecular mechanisms, foundation models may prove more valuable.

### Integration with Variant Interpretation Pipelines

SpliceAI scores can be incorporated into variant interpretation workflows alongside other evidence types discussed in @sec-cadd and @sec-veps:

**Complementarity with CADD**: While CADD provides genome-wide deleteriousness scores incorporating many feature types, SpliceAI offers more accurate predictions for the specific mechanism of splice disruption. In clinical practice, both scores contribute independent evidence.

**Integration with expression models**: ExPecto predicts expression effects of variants but does not model splicing directly. A variant might have minimal ExPecto effect but high SpliceAI Δ score if it disrupts splicing without affecting transcription. Combining predictions provides a more complete view of functional consequences.

**ClinVar evidence**: SpliceAI Δ scores can support splicing evidence in ACMG/AMP classification, particularly for variants outside canonical splice sites where experimental evidence is often lacking.

## Limitations and Considerations

### Tissue Specificity

SpliceAI predicts splice sites based on sequence alone, without modeling tissue-specific alternative splicing. The same variant may have different effects across tissues depending on the expression of splicing factors and regulatory RNAs. Tissue-specific models trained on RNA-seq annotations could address this limitation but would require careful handling of annotation completeness across tissues.

### Incomplete Penetrance

Many cryptic splice variants produce partial shifts in splicing (alternative splicing) rather than complete disruption. The Δ score correlates with penetrance, but precise quantification of isoform ratios requires experimental validation. For clinical interpretation, incomplete penetrance may lead to variable expressivity and reduced disease severity.

### Deep Intronic Predictions

While SpliceAI substantially improves deep intronic variant prediction over prior methods, sensitivity remains lower than for variants near exons. The 41% sensitivity (Δ ≥ 0.5) in deep intronic regions suggests that additional sequence features beyond the 10 kb context, or mechanisms not captured by the model, may contribute to splicing in these regions.

### Training on Canonical Transcripts

Training on principal transcripts may not fully capture the diversity of alternative splicing. Augmentation with RNA-seq-derived junctions improved performance, suggesting that expanded training data, including tissue-specific annotations, could further enhance predictions.

### Evaluation Circularity

As with all variant effect predictors, evaluation faces potential circularity (@sec-confound). If SpliceAI predictions influence variant classification in clinical databases, using those databases to benchmark newer models creates inflated performance estimates. The RNA-seq and population genetics validations provide more independent assessments but are not immune to selection biases.

## Significance for the Field

SpliceAI established several paradigms that influenced subsequent genomic deep learning:

**Clinical impact quantification**: The estimate that 9-11% of pathogenic mutations act through cryptic splicing fundamentally changed understanding of the noncoding disease mutation landscape. This finding has practical implications for diagnostic yield: including splice predictions in clinical analysis can identify diagnoses that would otherwise be missed.

**Deep context matters**: The 32-layer, 10 kb context architecture demonstrated that splicing involves long-range sequence integration, motivating similar approaches in other genomic prediction tasks. This insight carries forward to the transformer and hybrid models in Part III.

**Genome-wide variant scoring**: Precomputed Δ scores for all possible single nucleotide substitutions (available at https://github.com/Illumina/SpliceAI) enable routine clinical annotation without requiring per-variant model inference. This resource has been widely adopted in clinical and research pipelines.

**Validation standards**: The combination of RNA-seq validation, population genetics evidence, and case-control analysis established a rigorous framework for evaluating variant effect predictors. This multi-modal validation approach sets expectations for how genomic deep learning models should demonstrate biological validity.

**Mechanistic interpretability**: The in silico mutagenesis experiments showing learned recognition of branch points, exonic enhancers, and nucleosome positioning demonstrate that deep learning models can provide biological insights, not just predictions. This finding motivates the interpretability approaches examined in @sec-interp.

SpliceAI has become a standard component of clinical variant interpretation pipelines, complementing protein-effect predictors and regulatory variant scores. Its success illustrates both the power of task-specific deep learning and the value of rigorous biological validation for establishing clinical utility.

## Summary

This chapter examined SpliceAI as the culmination of Part II's CNN-based sequence-to-function models. Key themes include:

**Architectural progression**: From DeepSEA's 3-layer, 1 kb model to SpliceAI's 32-layer, 10 kb model, increasing depth and context enable capture of long-range biological dependencies.

**Task-specific versus general models**: SpliceAI's focus on a single, well-defined prediction task enables remarkable accuracy, illustrating the trade-off between specialization and generality that Part III will explore through foundation models.

**Clinical translation**: The disease association analyses demonstrate how sequence models can quantify clinical impact, estimate diagnostic yield, and guide resource allocation in rare disease research.

**Mechanistic insight**: Deep learning models trained on biological data can reveal genuine biological mechanisms, not just correlations, when combined with careful interpretability analyses.

**Validation rigor**: Multiple orthogonal validation approaches (RNA-seq, population genetics, case-control) establish confidence that model predictions reflect true biological effects.

Part III now turns to transformer-based architectures and self-supervised learning, approaches that aim to learn general-purpose sequence representations applicable across many tasks rather than optimizing for single prediction targets.
