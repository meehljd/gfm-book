	abstract = {The next phase of genome biology research requires understanding how DNA sequence encodes phenotypes, from the molecular to organismal levels. How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequence through the use of a new deep learning architecture called Enformer that is able to integrate long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Notably, Enformer outperformed the best team on the critical assessment of genome interpretation (CAGI5) challenge for noncoding variant interpretation with no additional training. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict promoter-enhancer interactions directly from DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of growing human disease associations to cell-type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution. To foster these downstream applications, we have made the pre-trained Enformer model openly available, and provide pre-computed effect predictions for all common variants in the 1000 Genomes dataset. One-sentence summary Improved noncoding variant effect prediction and candidate enhancer prioritization from a more accurate sequence to expression model driven by extended long-range interaction modelling.},

	abstract = {Epigenomic profiling has enabled large-scale identification of regulatory elements, yet we still lack a systematic mapping from any sequence or variant to regulatory activities. We address this challenge with Sei, a framework for integrating human genetics data with sequence information to discover the regulatory basis of traits and diseases. Sei learns a vocabulary of regulatory activities, called sequence classes, using a deep learning model that predicts 21,907 chromatin profiles across {\textgreater}1,300 cell lines and tissues. Sequence classes provide a global classification and quantification of sequence and variant effects based on diverse regulatory activities, such as cell type-specific enhancer functions. These predictions are supported by tissue-specific expression, expression quantitative trait loci and evolutionary constraint data. Furthermore, sequence classes enable characterization of the tissue-specific, regulatory architecture of complex traits and generate mechanistic hypotheses for individual regulatory pathogenic mutations. We provide Sei as a resource to elucidate the regulatory basis of human health and disease.},

	abstract = {Sequence-based machine-learning models trained on genomics data improve genetic variant interpretation by providing functional predictions describing their impact on the cis-regulatory code. However, current tools do not predict RNA-seq expression profiles because of modeling challenges. Here, we introduce Borzoi, a model that learns to predict cell-type-specific and tissue-specific RNA-seq coverage from DNA sequence. Using statistics derived from Borzoi’s predicted coverage, we isolate and accurately score DNA variant effects across multiple layers of regulation, including transcription, splicing and polyadenylation. Evaluated on quantitative trait loci, Borzoi is competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on individual regulatory functions. By applying attribution methods to the derived statistics, we extract cis-regulatory motifs driving RNA expression and post-transcriptional regulation in normal tissues. The wide availability of RNA-seq data across species, conditions and assays profiling specific aspects of regulation emphasizes the potential of this approach to decipher the mapping from DNA sequence to regulatory function.},
