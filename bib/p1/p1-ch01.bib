	abstract = {Haplotype phasing is the estimation of haplotypes from genotype data. We present a fast, accurate, and memory-efficient haplotype phasing method that scales to large-scale SNP array and sequence data. The method uses marker windowing and composite reference haplotypes to reduce memory usage and computation time. It incorporates a progressive phasing algorithm that identifies confidently phased heterozygotes in each iteration and fixes the phase of these heterozygotes in subsequent iterations. For data with many low-frequency variants, such as whole-genome sequence data, the method employs a two-stage phasing algorithm that phases high-frequency markers via progressive phasing in the first stage and phases low-frequency markers via genotype imputation in the second stage. This haplotype phasing method is implemented in the open-source Beagle 5.2 software package. We compare Beagle 5.2 and SHAPEIT 4.2.1 by using expanding subsets of 485,301 UK Biobank samples and 38,387 TOPMed samples. Both methods have very similar accuracy and computation time for UK Biobank SNP array data. However, for TOPMed sequence data, Beagle is more than 20 times faster than SHAPEIT, achieves similar accuracy, and scales to larger sample sizes.},

A rich variety of phenotypic and health-related information is available on each participant, including biological measurements, lifestyle indicators, biomarkers in blood and urine, and imaging of the body and brain. Follow-up information is provided by linking health and medical records. Genome-wide genotype data have been collected on all participants, providing many opportunities for the discovery of new genetic associations and the genetic bases of complex traits. Here we describe the centralized analysis of the genetic data, including genotype quality, properties of population structure and relatedness of the genetic data, and efficient phasing and genotype imputation that increases the number of testable variants to around 96 million. Classical allelic variation at 11 human leukocyte antigen genes was imputed, resulting in the recovery of signals with known associations between human leukocyte antigen alleles and many diseases.},

	abstract = {There are two major paradigms in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology: short-read sequencing and long-read sequencing. Short-read sequencing approaches provide lower-cost, higher-accuracy data that are useful for population-level research and clinical variant discovery. By contrast, long-read approaches provide read lengths that are well suited for de novo genome assembly applications and full-length isoform sequencing.NGS technologies have been evolving over the past 10 years, leading to substantial improvements in quality and yield; however, certain approaches have proven to be more effective and adaptable than others.Recent improvements in chemistry, costs, throughput and accessibility are driving the emergence of new, varied technologies to address applications that were not previously possible. These include integrated long-read and short-read sequencing studies, routine clinical DNA sequencing, real-time pathogen DNA monitoring and massive population-level projects.Although massive strides are being made in this technology, several notable limitations remain. The time required to sequence and analyse data limits the use of NGS in clinical applications in which time is an important factor; the costs and error rates of long-read sequencing make it prohibitive for routine use, and ethical considerations can limit the public and private use of genetic data.We can expect increasing democratization and options for NGS in the future. Many new instruments with varied chemistries and applications are being released or being developed.},

However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

This team addressed challenges in (1) matching variant calls with different representations, (2) defining standard performance metrics, (3) enabling stratification of performance by variant type and genome context, and (4) developing and describing limitations of high-confidence calls and regions that can be used as “truth”. Our methods are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/ga4gh/benchmarking-tools) and in a web-based app on precisionFDA, which allow users to compare their variant calls against truth sets and to obtain a standardized report on their variant calling performance. Our methods have been piloted in the precisionFDA variant calling challenges to identify the best-in-class variant calling methods within high-confidence regions.

However, in the lack of an unbiased whole-genome truth set, the global error rate of variant calls and the leading causal artifacts still remain unclear even given the great efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods. Results: We made ten SNP and INDEL call sets with two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid human genome and a diploid genome at a similar coverage. By investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid genome, we identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions and the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as the two major sources of errors, which press for continued improvements in these two areas. We estimated that the error rate of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in 10-15kb, but the error rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100-200kb without significant compromise on the sensitivity.

Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. We also add 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90 million of the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced small variant discovery errors by 34\% and increased the number of structural variants detected per haplotype by 104\% compared with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample.},

In this global, multicenter, prospective, randomized study, 1956 patients with HIV-1 infection who had not previously received abacavir were randomly assigned to undergo HLA-B*5701 screening or to receive the standard of care. Screening eliminated immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir in this predominantly white population. In this case, a pharmacogenetic test can prevent the toxic effects of this drug. Hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir are tightly associated with HLA-B*5701. In this study of patients with HIV-1 infection, HLA-B*5701 screening eliminated immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Pharmacogenetic testing is not widely used in routine clinical practice to optimize drug choice or clinical management.1 This gap between scientific knowledge and clinical application may be explained by the fact that the successful incorporation of a pharmacogenetic test into routine practice requires a combination of high-level evidence that can be generalized to diverse clinical settings, widespread availability of cost-effective and reliable laboratory tests, and effective strategies to incorporate testing into routine clinical practice.

	abstract = {Many existing cohorts contain a range of relatedness between genotyped individuals, either by design or by chance. Haplotype estimation in such cohorts is a central step in many downstream analyses. Using genotypes from six cohorts from isolated populations and two cohorts from non-isolated populations, we have investigated the performance of different phasing methods designed for nominally ‘unrelated’ individuals. We find that SHAPEIT2 produces much lower switch error rates in all cohorts compared to other methods, including those designed specifically for isolated populations. In particular, when large amounts of IBD sharing is present, SHAPEIT2 infers close to perfect haplotypes. Based on these results we have developed a general strategy for phasing cohorts with any level of implicit or explicit relatedness between individuals. First SHAPEIT2 is run ignoring all explicit family information. We then apply a novel HMM method (duoHMM) to combine the SHAPEIT2 haplotypes with any family information to infer the inheritance pattern of each meiosis at all sites across each chromosome. This allows the correction of switch errors, detection of recombination events and genotyping errors. We show that the method detects numbers of recombination events that align very well with expectations based on genetic maps, and that it infers far fewer spurious recombination events than Merlin. The method can also detect genotyping errors and infer recombination events in otherwise uninformative families, such as trios and duos. The detected recombination events can be used in association scans for recombination phenotypes. The method provides a simple and unified approach to haplotype estimation, that will be of interest to researchers in the fields of human, animal and plant genetics.},

This region is the most polymorphic region of the human genome, and the levels of polymorphism seen exceed most other genes. Some of the genes have several thousand variants and are now termed hyperpolymorphic, rather than just simply polymorphic. The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database has provided a stable, highly accessible, user-friendly repository for this information, providing the scientific and medical community access to the many variant sequences of this gene system, that are critical for the successful outcome of transplantation. The number of currently known variants, and dramatic increase in the number of new variants being identified has necessitated a dedicated resource with custom tools for curation and publication. The challenge for the database is to continue to provide a highly curated database of sequence variants, while supporting the increased number of submissions and complexity of sequences. In order to do this, traditional methods of accessing and presenting data will be challenged, and new methods will need to be utilized to keep pace with new discoveries.},

In many diseases, HLA explains more heritability than all other known loci combined. In silico HLA imputation methods enable rapid and accurate estimation of HLA alleles in the millions of individuals that are already genotyped on microarrays. HLA imputation has been used to define causal variation in autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, and in human immunodeficiency virus infection control. However, there are few guidelines on performing HLA imputation, association testing, and fine mapping. Here, we present a comprehensive tutorial to impute HLA alleles from genotype data. We provide detailed guidance on performing standard quality control measures for input genotyping data and describe options to impute HLA alleles and amino acids either locally or using the web-based Michigan Imputation Server, which hosts a multi-ancestry HLA imputation reference panel. We also offer best practice recommendations to conduct association tests to define the alleles, amino acids, and haplotypes that affect human traits. Along with the pipeline, we provide a step-by-step online guide with scripts and available software (https://github.com/immunogenomics/HLA\_analyses\_tutorial). This tutorial will be broadly applicable to large-scale genotyping data and will contribute to defining the role of HLA in human diseases across global populations.},

Third-generation nanopore sequence data have demonstrated a long read length, but current interpretation methods for their novel pore-based signal have unique error profiles, making accurate analysis challenging. Here, we introduce a haplotype-aware variant calling pipeline, PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant, that produces state-of-the-art variant calling results with nanopore data. We show that our nanopore-based method outperforms the short-read-based single-nucleotide-variant identification method at the whole-genome scale and produces high-quality single-nucleotide variants in segmental duplications and low-mappability regions where short-read-based genotyping fails. We show that our pipeline can provide highly contiguous phase blocks across the genome with nanopore reads, contiguously spanning between 85\% and 92\% of annotated genes across six samples. We also extend PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant to PacBio HiFi data, providing an efficient solution with superior performance over the current WhatsHap-DeepVariant standard. Finally, we demonstrate de novo assembly polishing methods that use nanopore and PacBio HiFi reads to produce diploid assemblies with high accuracy (Q35+ nanopore-polished and Q40+ PacBio HiFi-polished).},

Sniffles2 is 11.8 times faster and 29\% more accurate than state-of-the-art SV callers across different coverages (5–50×), sequencing technologies (ONT and HiFi) and SV types. Furthermore, Sniffles2 solves the problem of family-level to population-level SV calling to produce fully genotyped VCF files. Across 11 probands, we accurately identified causative SVs around MECP2, including highly complex alleles with three overlapping SVs. Sniffles2 also enables the detection of mosaic SVs in bulk long-read data. As a result, we identified multiple mosaic SVs in brain tissue from a patient with multiple system atrophy.

We applied T1K on CD8+ T cell single-cell RNA-seq data, and identified that KIR2DL4 allele expression levels were enriched in tumor-specific CD8+ T cells.},

	abstract = {The DNA sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8\%) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5 kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91\% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98\% for insertions and deletions {\textless}50 bp (indels) and 95.99\% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the ‘genome in a bottle’ (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64\%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of {\textgreater}15 megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997\%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads.},

	abstract = {Population-scale sequenced cohorts are foundational resources for genetic analyses, but processing raw reads into analysis-ready cohort-level variants remains challenging.We introduce an open-source cohort-calling method that uses the highly accurate caller DeepVariant and scalable merging tool GLnexus. Using callset quality metrics based on variant recall and precision in benchmark samples and Mendelian consistency in father-mother-child trios, we optimize the method across a range of cohort sizes, sequencing methods and sequencing depths. The resulting callsets show consistent quality improvements over those generated using existing best practices with reduced cost. We further evaluate our pipeline in the deeply sequenced 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) samples and show superior callset quality metrics and imputation reference panel performance compared to an independently generated GATK Best Practices pipeline.We publicly release the 1KGP individual-level variant calls and cohort callset (https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/brain-genomics-public/research/cohort/1KGP) to foster additional development and evaluation of cohort merging methods as well as broad studies of genetic variation. Both DeepVariant (https://github.com/google/deepvariant) and GLnexus (https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus) are open-source, and the optimized GLnexus setup discovered in this study is also integrated into GLnexus public releases v1.2.2 and later.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here, as part of the Genome in a Bottle Consortium (GIAB), we apply a reproducible, cloud-based pipeline to integrate multiple short and linked read sequencing datasets and provide benchmark calls for human genomes. We generate benchmark calls for one previously analyzed GIAB sample, as well as six broadly-consented genomes from the Personal Genome Project. These new genomes have broad, open consent, making this a ‘first of its kind’ resource that is available to the community for multiple downstream applications. We produce 17\% more benchmark SNVs, 176\% more indels, and 12\% larger benchmark regions than previously published GIAB benchmarks. We demonstrate this benchmark reliably identifies errors in existing callsets and highlight challenges in interpreting performance metrics when using benchmarks that are not perfect or comprehensive. Finally, we identify strengths and weaknesses of callsets by stratifying performance according to variant type and genome context.},
