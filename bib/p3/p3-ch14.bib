	abstract = {Modeling the effect of sequence variation on function is a fundamental problem for understanding and designing proteins. Since evolution encodes information about function into patterns in protein sequences, unsupervised models of variant effects can be learned from sequence data. The approach to date has been to fit a model to a family of related sequences. The conventional setting is limited, since a new model must be trained for each prediction task. We show that using only zero-shot inference, without any supervision from experimental data or additional training, protein language models capture the functional effects of sequence variation, performing at state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the pathogenicity of protein variants in human disease-related genes would have a marked effect on clinical decisions, yet the overwhelming majority (over 98\%) of these variants still have unknown consequences1–3. In principle, computational methods could support the large-scale interpretation of genetic variants. However, state-of-the-art methods4–10 have relied on training machine learning models on known disease labels. As these labels are sparse, biased and of variable quality, the resulting models have been considered insufficiently reliable11. Here we propose an approach that leverages deep generative models to predict variant pathogenicity without relying on labels. By modelling the distribution of sequence variation across organisms, we implicitly capture constraints on the protein sequences that maintain fitness. Our model EVE (evolutionary model of variant effect) not only outperforms computational approaches that rely on labelled data but also performs on par with, if not better than, predictions from high-throughput experiments, which are increasingly used as evidence for variant classification12–16. We predict the pathogenicity of more than 36 million variants across 3,219 disease genes and provide evidence for the classification of more than 256,000 variants of unknown significance. Our work suggests that models of evolutionary information can provide valuable independent evidence for variant interpretation that will be widely useful in research and clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Missense variants remain a challenge in genetic interpretation owing to their subtle and context-dependent effects. Although current prediction models perform well in known disease genes, their scores are not calibrated across the proteome, limiting generalizability. To address this knowledge gap, we developed popEVE, a deep generative model combining evolutionary and human population data to estimate variant deleteriousness on a proteome-wide scale. popEVE achieves state-of-the-art performance without overestimating the burden of deleterious variants and identifies variants in 442 genes in a severe developmental disorder cohort, including 123 novel candidates. These genes are functionally similar to known disease genes, and their variants often localize to critical regions. Remarkably, popEVE can prioritize likely causal variants using only child exomes, enabling diagnosis even without parental sequencing. This work provides a generalizable framework for rare disease variant interpretation, especially in singleton cases, and demonstrates the utility of calibrated, evolution-informed scoring models for clinical genomics.},

The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect.

	abstract = {The next phase of genome biology research requires understanding how DNA sequence encodes phenotypes, from the molecular to organismal levels. How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequence through the use of a new deep learning architecture called Enformer that is able to integrate long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Notably, Enformer outperformed the best team on the critical assessment of genome interpretation (CAGI5) challenge for noncoding variant interpretation with no additional training. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict promoter-enhancer interactions directly from DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of growing human disease associations to cell-type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution. To foster these downstream applications, we have made the pre-trained Enformer model openly available, and provide pre-computed effect predictions for all common variants in the 1000 Genomes dataset.

	abstract = {All of life encodes information with DNA. While tools for sequencing, synthesis, and editing of genomic code have transformed biological research, intelligently composing new biological systems would also require a deep understanding of the immense complexity encoded by genomes. We introduce Evo 2, a biological foundation model trained on 9.3 trillion DNA base pairs from a highly curated genomic atlas spanning all domains of life. We train Evo 2 with 7B and 40B parameters to have an unprecedented 1 million token context window with single-nucleotide resolution. Evo 2 learns from DNA sequence alone to accurately predict the functional impacts of genetic variation—from noncoding pathogenic mutations to clinically significant BRCA1 variants—without task-specific finetuning. Applying mechanistic interpretability analyses, we reveal that Evo 2 autonomously learns a breadth of biological features, including exon–intron boundaries, transcription factor binding sites, protein structural elements, and prophage genomic regions. Beyond its predictive capabilities, Evo 2 generates mitochondrial, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic sequences at genome scale with greater naturalness and coherence than previous methods. Guiding Evo 2 via inference-time search enables controllable generation of epigenomic structure, for which we demonstrate the first inference-time scaling results in biology. We make Evo 2 fully open, including model parameters, training code, inference code, and the OpenGenome2 dataset, to accelerate the exploration and design of biological complexity.},
