	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has long promised to increase healthcare affordability, quality and accessibility but FDA, until recently, had never authorized an autonomous AI diagnostic system. This pivotal trial of an AI system to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) in people with diabetes enrolled 900 subjects, with no history of DR at primary care clinics, by comparing to Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center (FPRC) widefield stereoscopic photography and macular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), by FPRC certified photographers, and FPRC grading of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Severity Scale (ETDRS) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). More than mild DR (mtmDR) was defined as ETDRS level 35 or higher, and/or DME, in at least one eye. AI system operators underwent a standardized training protocol before study start. Median age was 59 years (range, 22–84 years); among participants, 47.5\% of participants were male; 16.1\% were Hispanic, 83.3\% not Hispanic; 28.6\% African American and 63.4\% were not; 198 (23.8\%) had mtmDR. The AI system exceeded all pre-specified superiority endpoints at sensitivity of 87.2\% (95\% CI, 81.8–91.2\%) ({\textgreater}85\%), specificity of 90.7\% (95\% CI, 88.3–92.7\%) ({\textgreater}82.5\%), and imageability rate of 96.1\% (95\% CI, 94.6–97.3\%), demonstrating AI’s ability to bring specialty-level diagnostics to primary care settings. Based on these results, FDA authorized the system for use by health care providers to detect more than mild DR and diabetic macular edema, making it, the first FDA authorized autonomous AI diagnostic system in any field of medicine, with the potential to help prevent vision loss in thousands of people with diabetes annually.

	abstract = {The introduction of AlphaFold 21 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design2–6. Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8. Together, these results show that high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep-learning framework.},

	abstract = {Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here, we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks toward that goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59\% and 71\% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose cell-type-specific gene-expression predictions based solely on primary sequences as a grand challenge for the field.},

OMIM is based on the published peer-reviewed biomedical literature and is used by overlapping and diverse communities of clinicians, molecular biologists and genome scientists, as well as by students and teachers of these disciplines. Genes and phenotypes are described in separate entries and are given unique, stable six-digit identifiers (MIM numbers). OMIM entries have a structured free-text format that provides the flexibility necessary to describe the complex and nuanced relationships between genes and genetic phenotypes in an efficient manner. OMIM also has a derivative table of genes and genetic phenotypes, the Morbid Map. OMIM.org has enhanced search capabilities such as genome coordinate searching and thesaurus-enhanced search term options. Phenotypic series have been created to facilitate viewing genetic heterogeneity of phenotypes. Clinical synopsis features are enhanced with UMLS, Human Phenotype Ontology and Elements of Morphology terms and image links. All OMIM data are available for FTP download and through an API. MIMmatch is a novel outreach feature to disseminate updates and encourage collaboration.},

	abstract = {The next phase of genome biology research requires understanding how DNA sequence encodes phenotypes, from the molecular to organismal levels. How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequence through the use of a new deep learning architecture called Enformer that is able to integrate long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Notably, Enformer outperformed the best team on the critical assessment of genome interpretation (CAGI5) challenge for noncoding variant interpretation with no additional training. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict promoter-enhancer interactions directly from DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of growing human disease associations to cell-type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution. To foster these downstream applications, we have made the pre-trained Enformer model openly available, and provide pre-computed effect predictions for all common variants in the 1000 Genomes dataset.

	abstract = {The expanding catalog of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provides biological insights across a variety of species, but identifying the causal variants behind these associations remains a significant challenge. Experimental validation is both labor-intensive and costly, highlighting the need for accurate, scalable computational methods to predict the effects of genetic variants across the entire genome. Inspired by recent progress in natural language processing, unsupervised pretraining on large protein sequence databases has proven successful in extracting complex information related to proteins. These models showcase their ability to learn variant effects in coding regions using an unsupervised approach. Expanding on this idea, we here introduce the Genomic Pre-trained Network (GPN), a model designed to learn genome-wide variant effects through unsupervised pretraining on genomic DNA sequences. Our model also successfully learns gene structure and DNA motifs without any supervision. To demonstrate its utility, we train GPN on unaligned reference genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and seven related species within the Brassicales order and evaluate its ability to predict the functional impact of genetic variants in A. thaliana by utilizing allele frequencies from the 1001 Genomes Project and a comprehensive database of GWAS. Notably, GPN outperforms predictors based on popular conservation scores such as phyloP and phastCons. Our predictions for A. thaliana can be visualized as sequence logos in the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/gbenegas/gpn-arabidopsis). We provide code (https://github.com/songlab-cal/gpn) to train GPN for any given species using its DNA sequence alone, enabling unsupervised prediction of variant effects across the entire genome.},

	abstract = {Machine learning holds immense promise in biology, particularly for the challenging task of identifying causal variants for Mendelian and complex traits. Two primary approaches have emerged for this task: supervised sequence-to-function models trained on functional genomics experimental data and self-supervised DNA language models that learn evolutionary constraints on sequences. However, the field currently lacks consistently curated datasets with accurate labels, especially for non-coding variants, that are necessary to comprehensively benchmark these models and advance the field. In this work, we present TraitGym, a curated dataset of regulatory genetic variants that are either known to be causal or are strong candidates across 113 Mendelian and 83 complex traits, along with carefully constructed control variants. We frame the causal variant prediction task as a binary classification problem and benchmark various models, including functional-genomics-supervised models, self-supervised models, models that combine machine learning predictions with curated annotation features, and ensembles of these. Our results provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of different approaches for predicting the functional consequences of non-coding genetic variants. We find that alignment-based models CADD and GPN-MSA compare favorably for Mendelian traits and complex disease traits, while functional-genomics-supervised models Enformer and Borzoi perform better for complex non-disease traits. The benchmark, including a Google Colab notebook to evaluate a model in a few minutes, is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/songlab/TraitGym.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We previously developed an approach to calibrate computational tools for clinical variant classification, updating recommendations for the reliable use of variant impact predictors to provide evidence strength up to Strong. A new generation of tools using distinctive approaches has since been released, and these methods must be independently calibrated for clinical application. Methods: Using our local posterior probability-based calibration and our established data set of ClinVar pathogenic and benign variants, we determined the strength of evidence provided by 3 new tools (AlphaMissense, ESM1b, and VARITY) and calibrated scores meeting each evidence strength. Results: All 3 tools reached the Strong level of evidence for variant pathogenicity and Moderate for benignity, although sometimes for few variants. Compared with previously recommended tools, these yielded at best only modest improvements in the trade-offs between evidence strength and false-positive predictions. Conclusion: At calibrated thresholds, 3 new computational predictors provided evidence for variant pathogenicity at similar strength to the 4 previously recommended predictors (and comparable with functional assays for some variants). This calibration broadens the scope of computational tools for application in clinical variant classification. Their new approaches offer promise for future advancement of the field.},

While tools for sequencing, synthesis, and editing of genomic code have transformed biological research, intelligently composing new biological systems would also require a deep understanding of the immense complexity encoded by genomes. We introduce Evo 2, a biological foundation model trained on 9.3 trillion DNA base pairs from a highly curated genomic atlas spanning all domains of life. We train Evo 2 with 7B and 40B parameters to have an unprecedented 1 million token context window with single-nucleotide resolution. Evo 2 learns from DNA sequence alone to accurately predict the functional impacts of genetic variation—from noncoding pathogenic mutations to clinically significant BRCA1 variants—without task-specific finetuning. Applying mechanistic interpretability analyses, we reveal that Evo 2 autonomously learns a breadth of biological features, including exon–intron boundaries, transcription factor binding sites, protein structural elements, and prophage genomic regions. Beyond its predictive capabilities, Evo 2 generates mitochondrial, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic sequences at genome scale with greater naturalness and coherence than previous methods. Guiding Evo 2 via inference-time search enables controllable generation of epigenomic structure, for which we demonstrate the first inference-time scaling results in biology. We make Evo 2 fully open, including model parameters, training code, inference code, and the OpenGenome2 dataset, to accelerate the exploration and design of biological complexity.},

We present a fast, accurate, and memory-efficient haplotype phasing method that scales to large-scale SNP array and sequence data.

It incorporates a progressive phasing algorithm that identifies confidently phased heterozygotes in each iteration and fixes the phase of these heterozygotes in subsequent iterations. For data with many low-frequency variants, such as whole-genome sequence data, the method employs a two-stage phasing algorithm that phases high-frequency markers via progressive phasing in the first stage and phases low-frequency markers via genotype imputation in the second stage. This haplotype phasing method is implemented in the open-source Beagle 5.2 software package. We compare Beagle 5.2 and SHAPEIT 4.2.1 by using expanding subsets of 485,301 UK Biobank samples and 38,387 TOPMed samples. Both methods have very similar accuracy and computation time for UK Biobank SNP array data.

CpGPT leverages an improved transformer architecture to learn comprehensive representations of methylation patterns, allowing it to impute and reconstruct genome-wide methylation profiles from limited input data. By capturing sequence, positional, and epigenetic contexts, CpGPT outperforms specialized models when finetuned for aging-related tasks, including chronological age prediction, mortality risk, and morbidity assessments. The model is highly adaptable across different methylation platforms and tissue types. Furthermore, analysis of sample-specific attention weights enables the identification of the most influential CpG sites for individual predictions. As a foundation model, CpGPT sets a new benchmark for DNA methylation analysis, achieving strong performance in the Biomarkers of Aging Challenge, where it placed second overall in chronological age estimation and first on the public leaderboard in methylation-based mortality prediction.

The knockoff filter introduced by Barber and Candès provides a framework for variable selection in linear regression with FDR control. This method operates by creating knockoff copies of the covariates, constructing test statistics which treat the original features and knockoffs as exchangeable, and selecting those variables which are substantially better at explaining the response than their corresponding knockoffs. We extend the knockoff filter to a setting that is substantially more general. We make essentially no assumptions about the conditional distribution of the response—i.e. we do not assume any knowledge of Y|X—and we provide theoretical guarantees concerning the FDR in finite samples which are completely free of any modelling assumptions on Y|X.},

A major obstacle in integrating omics data from multiple modalities is that different omics layers typically have distinct feature spaces. Here, we propose a computational framework called GLUE (graph-linked unified embedding), which bridges the gap by modeling regulatory interactions across omics layers explicitly. Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE.},

	abstract = {Non-coding RNA structure and function are essential to understanding various biological processes, such as cell signaling, gene expression, and post-transcriptional regulations. These are all among the core problems in the RNA field. With the rapid growth of sequencing technology, we have accumulated a massive amount of unannotated RNA sequences. On the other hand, expensive experimental observatory results in only limited numbers of annotated data and 3D structures. Hence, it is still challenging to design computational methods for predicting their structures and functions. The lack of annotated data and systematic study causes inferior performance. To resolve the issue, we propose a novel RNA foundation model (RNA-FM) to take advantage of all the 23 million non-coding RNA sequences through self-supervised learning. Within this approach, we discover that the pre-trained RNA-FM could infer sequential and evolutionary information of non-coding RNAs without using any labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate RNA-FM's effectiveness by applying it to the downstream secondary/3D structure prediction, SARS-CoV-2 genome structure and evolution prediction, protein-RNA binding preference modeling, and gene expression regulation modeling. The comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method improves the RNA structural and functional modelling results significantly and consistently. Despite only being trained with unlabelled data, RNA-FM can serve as the foundational model for the field.},

However, effectively capturing the extensive long-range dependencies between DNA sequences, spanning millions of base pairs as seen in tasks such as three-dimensional (3D) chromatin folding, remains a significant challenge. Additionally, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating tasks reliant on long-range dependencies is notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce DNALONGBENCH, a benchmark dataset spanning five important genomics tasks that consider long-range dependencies up to 1 million base pairs: enhancer-target gene interaction, expression quantitative trait loci, 3D genome organization, regulatory sequence activity, and transcription initiation signal. To comprehensively assess DNALONGBENCH, we evaluate the performance of five baseline methods: a task-specific expert model, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model, and three fine-tuned DNA foundation models -- HyenaDNA, Caduceus-Ph and Caduceus-PS. We envision DNALONGBENCH having the potential to become a standardized resource that facilitates comprehensive comparisons and rigorous evaluations of emerging DNA sequence-based deep learning models that consider long-range dependencies.},

The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

	abstract = {A polygenic score (PGS) or polygenic risk score (PRS) is an estimate of an individual’s genetic liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation—genetic liability—has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges.},

FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling.

We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale.

	abstract = {Rare genetic variants can have strong effects on phenotypes, yet accounting for rare variants in genetic analyses is statistically challenging due to the limited number of allele carriers and the burden of multiple testing. While rich variant annotations promise to enable well-powered rare variant association tests, methods integrating variant annotations in a data-driven manner are lacking. Here we propose deep rare variant association testing (DeepRVAT), a model based on set neural networks that learns a trait-agnostic gene impairment score from rare variant annotations and phenotypes, enabling both gene discovery and trait prediction. On 34 quantitative and 63 binary traits, using whole-exome-sequencing data from UK Biobank, we find that DeepRVAT yields substantial gains in gene discoveries and improved detection of individuals at high genetic risk. Finally, we demonstrate how DeepRVAT enables calibrated and computationally efficient rare variant tests at biobank scale, aiding the discovery of genetic risk factors for human disease traits.},

Drawing parallels between language and cellular biology (in which texts comprise words; similarly, cells are defined by genes), our study probes the applicability of foundation models to advance cellular biology and genetic research. Using burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have constructed a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, based on a generative pretrained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through further adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications.

These transformer models yield context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate predictions even in low-data settings. We show that the developed models can be fine-tuned at low cost to solve a variety of genomics applications. Despite no supervision, the models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements and can be used to improve the prioritization of genetic variants.

Critical to its use in designing proteins with desired properties, machine learning models must capture the protein sequence-function relationship, often termed fitness landscape.

In this work, we introduce Fitness Landscape Inference for Proteins (FLIP), a benchmark for function prediction to encourage rapid scoring of representation learning for protein engineering. Our curated tasks, baselines, and metrics probe model generalization in settings relevant for protein engineering, e.g. low-resource and extrapolative.

	abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization—the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception—provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization—the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.Genetic epidemiology—the theme of this issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology—is seen by many to be the only future for epidemiology, perhaps reflecting a growing awareness of the limitations of observational epidemiology1 (Box 1). Genetic epidemiology is concerned with understanding heritable aspects of disease risk, individual susceptibility to disease, and ultimately with contributing to a comprehensive molecular understanding of pathogenesis. The massive investment and expansion of human genetics, if it is to return value for the common good, must be integrated into public health functions. The human genome epidemiology network (HuGE Net—http://www.cdc.gov/genetics/huge.htm) has been established to promote the use of genetic knowledge—in terms of genetic tests and services—for disease prevention and health promotion.2,3 A broad taxonomy of human genome studies of public health relevance has been developed4 (Box 2). In this issue of the IJE, we publish a paper by Miguel Porta,5 who highlights the need for a more rational approach to genetic testing, given the likely low penetrance of many genes associated with cancers,6 likening the role of the genome to a jazz score that is interpreted and developed through experience and context—and is seldom predictable. Such insights may well temper enthusiasm for genetic testing in populations. However, in parallel to the approaches advocated by HuGE, genetic epidemiology can lead to a more robust understanding of environmental determinants of disease (e.g. dietary factors, occupational exposures, and health-related behaviours) relevant to whole populations (and not simply to genetically susceptible sub-populations).7–10 This approach has recently been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization’.11–15 Here we begin by briefly reviewing reasons for current concerns about aetiological findings generated by conventional observational epidemiology and then we outline the potential contribution (and limitations) of Mendelian randomization.Box 1 ‘Epidemiology set to get fast-track treatment’‘A consortium of leading European research centres and pharmaceutical companies will this week announce a plan to transform epidemiology by combining it with the new techniques of high-throughput biology. They plan to create a new field of study—genomic epidemiology—by using screening technologies derived from the human genome project … We think it is important to expand classical epidemiology and genetic epidemiology to take it to this high-throughput mode, says Esper Boel, vice-president of biotechnology research at Novo Nordisk.

Here, we measure the expression output of {\textgreater}100 million synthetic yeast promoter sequences that are fully random. These sequences yield diverse, reproducible expression levels that can be explained by their chance inclusion of functional TF binding sites. We use machine learning to build interpretable models of transcriptional regulation that predict {\textasciitilde}94\% of the expression driven from independent test promoters and {\textasciitilde}89\% of the expression driven from native yeast promoter fragments. These models allow us to characterize each TF’s specificity, activity and interactions with chromatin. TF activity depends on binding-site strand, position, DNA helical face and chromatin context. Notably, expression level is influenced by weak regulatory interactions, which confound designed-sequence studies.

We find that predictive performance of European ancestry-derived polygenic scores is lower in non-European ancestry samples (e.g. African ancestry samples: t = −5.97, df = 24, p = 3.7 × 10−6), and we demonstrate the effects of methodological choices in polygenic score distributions for worldwide populations. These findings highlight the need for improved treatment of linkage disequilibrium and variant frequencies when applying polygenic scoring to cohorts of non-European ancestry, and bolster the rationale for large-scale GWAS in diverse human populations.},

GEO is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.},

	abstract = {Evidence for a major role of genetic factors in the determination of body mass index (BMI) comes from studies of related individuals. However, heritability estimates for BMI vary widely between studies and the reasons for this remain unclear. While some variation is natural due to differences between populations and settings, study design factors may also explain some of the heterogeneity. We performed a systematic review that identified eighty-eight independent estimates of BMI heritability from twin studies (total 140,525 twins) and twenty-seven estimates from family studies (42,968 family members). BMI heritability estimates from twin studies ranged from 0.47 to 0.90 (5th/50th/95th centiles: 0.58/0.75/0.87) and were generally higher than those from family studies (range: 0.24-0.81; 5th/50th/95th centiles: 0.25/0.46/0.68). Meta-regression of the results from twin studies showed that BMI heritability estimates were 0.07 (P=0.001) higher in children than in adults; estimates increased with mean age among childhood studies (+0.012 per year, P=0.002), but decreased with mean age in adult studies (-0.002 per year, P=0.002). Heritability estimates derived from AE twin models (which assume no contribution of shared environment) were 0.12 higher than those from ACE models (P\&lt;0.001), whilst lower estimates were associated with self-reported versus DNA-based determination of zygosity (-0.04, P=0.02), and with self-reported versus measured BMI (-0.05, P=0.03). Together, the above factors explained 47\% of the heterogeneity in estimates of BMI heritability from twin studies. In summary, while some variation in BMI heritability is expected due to population-level differences, study design factors explained nearly half the heterogeneity reported in twin studies. The genetic contribution to BMI appears to vary with age and may have a greater influence during childhood than adult life.},

These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81\%-87\%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81\%) and membrane vs. water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91\%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches. Taken together, the results implied that protein LMs learned some of the grammar of the language of life.

	abstract = {Privacy breaching techniques can work by cross-referencing two or more pieces of information to gain new, potentially harmful, knowledge on individuals or their families. Broadly speaking, the main routes to breach privacy are identity tracing, attribute disclosure attacks using DNA (ADAD) and completion of sensitive DNA information.Identity tracing exploits quasi-identifiers in the DNA data or metadata to uncover the identity of an unknown genetic data set. ADAD links the identity of a known person to a sensitive phenotype using DNA-derived data. Completion techniques also work on known DNA data and aim to uncover sensitive genomic areas that were masked to protect the participant.In the past few years, the range of techniques and tools to carry out privacy breaching attacks has expanded. Although most of these techniques are currently beyond the reach of the general public, they can be implemented by trained persons with varying degrees of effort and success.There is considerable debate regarding risk management. Some support a pragmatic, ad-hoc approach of privacy by obscurity, whereas others support a systematic, mathematical approach of privacy by design. Privacy-by-design algorithms include access control, differential privacy and cryptographic techniques.So far, data custodians of genetic databases have primarily adopted access control as a mitigation strategy. New developments in cryptographic methods may usher in additional 'security-by-design' techniques.},

The result is a sparsely-activated model---with an outrageous number of parameters---but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus", and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.},

The generated proteins display natural amino acid propensities, while disorder predictions indicate that 88\% of ProtGPT2-generated proteins are globular, in line with natural sequences. Sensitive sequence searches in protein databases show that ProtGPT2 sequences are distantly related to natural ones, and similarity networks further demonstrate that ProtGPT2 is sampling unexplored regions of protein space. AlphaFold prediction of ProtGPT2-sequences yields well-folded non-idealized structures with embodiments and large loops and reveals topologies not captured in current structure databases.

The challenge they pose is epitomized by BRCA1, a tumour suppressor gene in which germline loss-of-function variants predispose women to breast and ovarian cancer. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Here we use saturation genome editing to assay 96.5\% of all possible single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of BRCA1. Functional effects for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Over 400 non-functional missense SNVs are identified, as well as around 300 SNVs that disrupt expression. We predict that these results will be immediately useful for the clinical interpretation of BRCA1 variants, and that this approach can be extended to overcome the challenge of variants of uncertain significance in additional clinically actionable genes.},

LOVD was designed to be easy to set up and maintain and follows the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) recommendations. Here we describe LOVD v.2.0, which adds enhanced flexibility and functionality and has the capacity to store sequence variants in multiple genes per patient. To reduce redundancy, patient and sequence variant data are stored in separate tables. Tables are linked to generate connections between sequence variant data for each gene and every patient. The dynamic structure allows database managers to add custom columns. The database structure supports fast queries and allows storage of sequence variants from high-throughput sequence analysis, as demonstrated by the X-chromosomal Mental Retardation LOVD installation. LOVD contains measures to ensure database security from unauthorized access. Currently, the LOVD Website (http://www.LOVD.nl/) lists 71 public LOVD installations hosting 3,294 gene variant databases with 199,000 variants in 84,000 patients.

	abstract = {Quantifying the pathogenicity of protein variants in human disease-related genes would have a marked effect on clinical decisions, yet the overwhelming majority (over 98\%) of these variants still have unknown consequences1–3. In principle, computational methods could support the large-scale interpretation of genetic variants. However, state-of-the-art methods4–10 have relied on training machine learning models on known disease labels. As these labels are sparse, biased and of variable quality, the resulting models have been considered insufficiently reliable11. Here we propose an approach that leverages deep generative models to predict variant pathogenicity without relying on labels. By modelling the distribution of sequence variation across organisms, we implicitly capture constraints on the protein sequences that maintain fitness. Our model EVE (evolutionary model of variant effect) not only outperforms computational approaches that rely on labelled data but also performs on par with, if not better than, predictions from high-throughput experiments, which are increasingly used as evidence for variant classification12–16. We predict the pathogenicity of more than 36 million variants across 3,219 disease genes and provide evidence for the classification of more than 256,000 variants of unknown significance. Our work suggests that models of evolutionary information can provide valuable independent evidence for variant interpretation that will be widely useful in research and clinical settings.},

	abstract = {In interphase, the human genome sequence folds in three dimensions into a rich variety of locus-specific contact patterns. Cohesin and CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) are key regulators; perturbing the levels of either greatly disrupts genome-wide folding as assayed by chromosome conformation capture methods. Still, how a given DNA sequence encodes a particular locus-specific folding pattern remains unknown. Here we present a convolutional neural network, Akita, that accurately predicts genome folding from DNA sequence alone. Representations learned by Akita underscore the importance of an orientation-specific grammar for CTCF binding sites. Akita learns predictive nucleotide-level features of genome folding, revealing effects of nucleotides beyond the core CTCF motif. Once trained, Akita enables rapid in silico predictions. Accounting for this, we demonstrate how Akita can be used to perform in silico saturation mutagenesis, interpret eQTLs, make predictions for structural variants and probe species-specific genome folding. Collectively, these results enable decoding genome function from sequence through structure.},

	abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs – extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

Here, we present PRS-CS, a polygenic prediction method that infers posterior effect sizes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using genome-wide association summary statistics and an external linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference panel. PRS-CS utilizes a high-dimensional Bayesian regression framework, and is distinct from previous work by placing a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on SNP effect sizes, which is robust to varying genetic architectures, provides substantial computational advantages, and enables multivariate modeling of local LD patterns. Simulation studies using data from the UK Biobank show that PRS-CS outperforms existing methods across a wide range of genetic architectures, especially when the training sample size is large. We apply PRS-CS to predict six common complex diseases and six quantitative traits in the Partners HealthCare Biobank, and further demonstrate the improvement of PRS-CS in prediction accuracy over alternative methods.},

	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are relative measures of an individual’s genetic propensity to a particular trait or disease. Most PRS methods assume that mutation effects scale linearly with the number of alleles and are constant across individuals. While these assumptions simplify computation, they increase error, particularly for less-represented racial groups. We developed and provide Delphi (deep learning for phenotype inference), a deep-learning method that relaxes these assumptions to produce more predictive PRS. In contrast to other methods, Delphi can integrate up to hundreds of thousands of SNPs as input. We compare our results to a standard, linear PRS model, lasso regression, and a gradient-boosted trees-based method. We show that deep learning can be an effective approach to genetic risk prediction. We report a relative increase in the percentage variance explained compared to the state-of-the-art by 11.4\% for body mass index, 18.9\% for systolic blood pressure, 7.5\% for LDL, 35\% for C-reactive protein, 16.2\% for height, 29.6 \% for pulse rate; in addition, Delphi provides 2\% absolute explained variance for blood glucose while other tested methods were non-predictive. Furthermore, we show that Delphi tends to increase the weight of high-effect mutations. This work demonstrates an effective deep learning method for modeling genetic risk that also showed to generalize well when evaluated on individuals from non-European ancestries.},

By contrast, long-read approaches provide read lengths that are well suited for de novo genome assembly applications and full-length isoform sequencing.NGS technologies have been evolving over the past 10 years, leading to substantial improvements in quality and yield; however, certain approaches have proven to be more effective and adaptable than others.Recent improvements in chemistry, costs, throughput and accessibility are driving the emergence of new, varied technologies to address applications that were not previously possible. These include integrated long-read and short-read sequencing studies, routine clinical DNA sequencing, real-time pathogen DNA monitoring and massive population-level projects.Although massive strides are being made in this technology, several notable limitations remain. The time required to sequence and analyse data limits the use of NGS in clinical applications in which time is an important factor; the costs and error rates of long-read sequencing make it prohibitive for routine use, and ethical considerations can limit the public and private use of genetic data.We can expect increasing democratization and options for NGS in the future.

	abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5x higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-of-the-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling – a single-parameter variant of Platt Scaling – is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.},

	abstract = {Background: Twin studies have provided evidence that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to schizophrenia (SZ) risk. Heritability estimates of SZ in twin samples have varied methodologically. This study provides updated heritability estimates based on nationwide twin data and an improved statistical methodology. Methods: Combining two nationwide registers, the Danish Twin Register and the Danish Psychiatric Research Register, we identified a sample of twins born between 1951 and 2000 (N = 31,524 twin pairs). Twins were followed until June 1, 2011. Liability threshold models adjusting for censoring with inverse probability weighting were used to estimate probandwise concordance rates and heritability of the diagnoses of SZ and SZ spectrum disorders. Results: The probandwise concordance rate of SZ is 33\% in monozygotic twins and 7\% in dizygotic twins. We estimated the heritability of SZ to be 79\%. When expanding illness outcome to include SZ spectrum disorders, the heritability estimate was almost similar (73\%). Conclusions: The key strength of this study is the application of a novel statistical method accounting for censoring in the follow-up period to a nationwide twin sample. The estimated 79\% heritability of SZ is congruent with previous reports and indicates a substantial genetic risk. The high genetic risk also applies to a broader phenotype of SZ spectrum disorders. The low concordance rate of 33\% in monozygotic twins demonstrates that illness vulnerability is not solely indicated by genetic factors.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {Although genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of risk loci for complex traits, only a handful of the biologically causal variants, responsible for association at these loci, have been successfully identified. Current statistical methods for identifying causal variants at risk loci either use the strength of association signal in an iterative conditioning framework, or estimate probabilities for variants to be causal. A main drawback of existing methods is that they rely on the simplifying assumption of a single causal variant at each risk locus which is typically invalid at many risk loci. In this work, we propose a new statistical frameworks that allows for the possibility of an arbitrary number of causal variants when estimating the posterior probability of a variant being causal. A direct benefit of our approach is that we predict a set of variants for each locus that under reasonable assumptions will contain all of the true causal variants with a high confidence level (e.g. 95\%) even when the locus contains multiple causal variants. We use simulations to show that our approach provides 20-50\% improvement in our ability to identify the causal variants compared to the existing methods at loci harboring multiple causal variants. We validate our approach using empirical data from a eQTL study of CHI3L2 to identify new causal variants that affect gene expression at this locus.},

We augment training data by nearly three orders of magnitude by predicting structures for 12M protein sequences using AlphaFold2. Trained with this additional data, a sequence-to-sequence transformer with invariant geometric input processing layers achieves 51\% native sequence recovery on structurally held-out backbones with 72\% recovery for buried residues, an overall improvement of almost 10 percentage points over existing methods. The model generalizes to a variety of more complex tasks including design of protein complexes, partially masked structures, binding interfaces, and multiple states.},

	abstract = {The dominant paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, conventional fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example, deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is extremely expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. For GPT-3, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the computation hardware requirement by 3 times compared to full fine-tuning. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on both GPT-3 and GPT-2, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptations, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release our implementation in GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA .},

Improved methods for predicting the pathogenicity of rare coding variants are needed to facilitate the discovery of disease variants from exome sequencing studies. We developed REVEL (rare exome variant ensemble learner), an ensemble method for predicting the pathogenicity of missense variants on the basis of individual tools: MutPred, FATHMM, VEST, PolyPhen, SIFT, PROVEAN, MutationAssessor, MutationTaster, LRT, GERP, SiPhy, phyloP, and phastCons. REVEL was trained with recently discovered pathogenic and rare neutral missense variants, excluding those previously used to train its constituent tools. When applied to two independent test sets, REVEL had the best overall performance (p {\textless} 10−12) as compared to any individual tool and seven ensemble methods: MetaSVM, MetaLR, KGGSeq, Condel, CADD, DANN, and Eigen. Importantly, REVEL also had the best performance for distinguishing pathogenic from rare neutral variants with allele frequencies {\textless}0.5\%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for REVEL was 0.046–0.182 higher in an independent test set of 935 recent SwissVar disease variants and 123,935 putatively neutral exome sequencing variants and 0.027–0.143 higher in an independent test set of 1,953 pathogenic and 2,406 benign variants recently reported in ClinVar than the AUCs for other ensemble methods. We provide pre-computed REVEL scores for all possible human missense variants to facilitate the identification of pathogenic variants in the sea of rare variants discovered as sequencing studies expand in scale.},

Synonymous and intronic mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence validate at a high rate on RNA-seq and are strongly deleterious in the human population. De novo mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence are significantly enriched in patients with autism and intellectual disability compared to healthy controls and validate against RNA-seq in 21 out of 28 of these patients.

	abstract = {BERT is a recent language representation model that has surprisingly performed well in diverse language understanding benchmarks. This result indicates the possibility that BERT networks capture structural information about language. In this work, we provide novel support for this claim by performing a series of experiments to unpack the elements of English language structure learned by BERT. We first show that BERT's phrasal representation captures phrase-level information in the lower layers. We also show that BERT's intermediate layers encode a rich hierarchy of linguistic information, with surface features at the bottom, syntactic features in the middle and semantic features at the top. BERT turns out to require deeper layers when long-distance dependency information is required, e.g.{\textasciitilde}to track subject-verb agreement. Finally, we show that BERT representations capture linguistic information in a compositional way that mimics classical, tree-like structures.},

	abstract = {Deciphering the language of non-coding DNA is one of the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.The source code, pretrained and finetuned model for DNABERT are available at GitHub (https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Being high dimensional, incorporation of such data in one model is a challenge, often leading to one-dimensional studies and, therefore, information loss. Instead, we first propose relying on non-fixed sets of whole genome or whole exome variant-associated sequences, which can be used for supervised learning of oncology-relevant tasks by our Set Transformer based Deep Neural Network, SetQuence. We optimise this architecture to improve its efficiency. This allows for exploration of not just coding but also non-coding variants, from large datasets. Second, we extend the model to incorporate these representations together with multiple other sources of omics data in a flexible way with SetOmic. Evaluation, using these representations, shows improved robustness and reduced information loss compared to previous approaches, while still being computationally tractable. By means of Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods, our models are able to recapitulate the biological contribution of highly attributed features in the tumours studied. This validation opens the door to novel directions in multi-faceted genome and exome wide biomarker discovery and personalised treatment among other presently clinically relevant tasks.},

Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

However, the methods for involving participants have not kept pace with changes in research capability. In an era when information is shared digitally at the global level, mechanisms of informed consent remain static, paper-based and organised around national boundaries and legal frameworks. Dynamic consent (DC) is both a specific project and a wider concept that offers a new approach to consent; one designed to meet the needs of the twenty-first century research landscape. At the heart of DC is a personalised, digital communication interface that connects researchers and participants, placing participants at the heart of decision making. The interface facilitates two-way communication to stimulate a more engaged, informed and scientifically literate participant population where individuals can tailor and manage their own consent preferences. The technical architecture of DC includes components that can securely encrypt sensitive data and allow participant consent preferences to travel with their data and samples when they are shared with third parties. In addition to improving transparency and public trust, this system benefits researchers by streamlining recruitment and enabling more efficient participant recontact. DC has mainly been developed in biobanking contexts, but it also has potential application in other domains for a variety of purposes.},

We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

Rare variant association studies have linked inactivating mutations in at least nine genes with risk of coronary artery disease.Human genetics and large-scale biobanks can facilitate drug development for coronary artery disease by highlighting causal biology and helping to understand the phenotypic consequences of lifelong deficiency of a given protein.Genomic medicine may provide patients and their health care providers with genetic data that will aid in coronary artery disease prevention and treatment.Genome editing to introduce mutations that are protective against coronary artery disease into the population could prove curative with a one-time injection, although substantial additional work is needed to confirm efficacy and safety, and to address the underlying ethics.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of regions in the genome that contain genetic variants that increase risk for complex traits and diseases. However, the variants uncovered in GWAS are typically not biologically causal, but rather, correlated to the true causal variant through linkage disequilibrium (LD). To discern the true causal variant(s), a variety of statistical fine-mapping methods have been proposed to prioritize variants for functional validation.In this work we introduce a new approach, fastPAINTOR, that leverages evidence across correlated traits, as well as functional annotation data, to improve fine-mapping accuracy at pleiotropic risk loci. To improve computational efficiency, we describe an new importance sampling scheme to perform model inference. First, we demonstrate in simulations that by leveraging functional annotation data, fastPAINTOR increases fine-mapping resolution relative to existing methods. Next, we show that jointly modeling pleiotropic risk regions improves fine-mapping resolution compared to standard single trait and pleiotropic fine mapping strategies. We report a reduction in the number of SNPs required for follow-up in order to capture 90\% of the causal variants from 23 SNPs per locus using a single trait to 12 SNPs when fine-mapping two traits simultaneously. Finally, we analyze summary association data from a large-scale GWAS of lipids and show that these improvements are largely sustained in real data.The fastPAINTOR framework is implemented in the PAINTOR v3.0 package which is publicly available to the research community http://bogdan.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/software/paintorSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We precompute C scores for all 8.6 billion possible human single-nucleotide variants and enable scoring of short insertions-deletions. C scores correlate with allelic diversity, annotations of functionality, pathogenicity, disease severity, experimentally measured regulatory effects and complex trait associations, and they highly rank known pathogenic variants within individual genomes.

We show that in our samples, with an average father’s age of 29.7, the average de novo mutation rate is 1.20 × 10−8 per nucleotide per generation. Most notably, the diversity in mutation rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the father at conception of the child. The effect is an increase of about two mutations per year. An exponential model estimates paternal mutations doubling every 16.5 years. After accounting for random Poisson variation, father’s age is estimated to explain nearly all of the remaining variation in the de novo mutation counts. These observations shed light on the importance of the father’s age on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia and autism.},

	abstract = {Population isolates such as those in Finland benefit genetic research because deleterious alleles are often concentrated on a small number of low-frequency variants (0.1\% ≤ minor allele frequency {\textless} 5\%). These variants survived the founding bottleneck rather than being distributed over a large number of ultrarare variants. Although this effect is well established in Mendelian genetics, its value in common disease genetics is less explored1,2. FinnGen aims to study the genome and national health register data of 500,000 Finnish individuals. Given the relatively high median age of participants (63 years) and the substantial fraction of hospital-based recruitment, FinnGen is enriched for disease end points. Here we analyse data from 224,737 participants from FinnGen and study 15 diseases that have previously been investigated in large genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also include meta-analyses of biobank data from Estonia and the United Kingdom. We identified 30 new associations, primarily low-frequency variants, enriched in the Finnish population. A GWAS of 1,932 diseases also identified 2,733 genome-wide significant associations (893 phenome-wide significant (PWS), P {\textless} 2.6 × 10–11) at 2,496 (771 PWS) independent loci with 807 (247 PWS) end points. Among these, fine-mapping implicated 148 (73 PWS) coding variants associated with 83 (42 PWS) end points. Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of {\textless}5\% in non-Finnish European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, high impact variants.},

	abstract = {Prediction of disease risk is an essential part of preventative medicine, often guiding clinical management. Risk prediction typically includes risk factors such as age, sex, family history of disease and lifestyle (e.g. smoking status); however, in recent years, there has been increasing interest to include genomic information into risk models. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) aggregate the effects of many genetic variants across the human genome into a single score and have recently been shown to have predictive value for multiple common diseases. In this review, we summarize the potential use cases for seven common diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, obesity, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease) where PRS has or could have clinical utility. PRS analysis for these diseases frequently revolved around (i) risk prediction performance of a PRS alone and in combination with other non-genetic risk factors, (ii) estimation of lifetime risk trajectories, (iii) the independent information of PRS and family history of disease or monogenic mutations and (iv) estimation of the value of adding a PRS to specific clinical risk prediction scenarios. We summarize open questions regarding PRS usability, ancestry bias and transferability, emphasizing the need for the next wave of studies to focus on the implementation and health-economic value of PRS testing. In conclusion, it is becoming clear that PRS have value in disease risk prediction and there are multiple areas where this may have clinical utility.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have linked millions of genetic variants to biomedical phenotypes, but their utility has been limited by lack of mechanistic understanding and widespread epistatic interactions. Recently, Transformer models have emerged as a powerful machine learning architecture with potential to address these and other challenges. Accordingly, here we introduce the Genotype-to-Phenotype Transformer (G2PT), a framework for modeling hierarchical information flow among variants, genes, multigenic systems, and phenotypes. As proof-of-concept, we use G2PT to model the genetics of TG/HDL (triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), an indicator of metabolic health. G2PT predicts this trait via attention to 1,395 variants underlying at least 20 systems, including immune response and cholesterol transport, with accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art. It implicates 40 epistatic interactions, including epistasis between APOA4 and CETP in phospholipid transfer, a target pathway for cholesterol modification. This work positions hierarchical graph transformers as a next-generation approach to polygenic risk.},

Even small proteins or peptides can be encoded by an enormously large number of mRNAs. The actual mRNA sequence can have a large impact on several properties including expression, stability, immunogenicity, and more. To enable the selection of an optimal sequence, we developed CodonBERT, a large language model (LLM) for mRNAs. Unlike prior models, CodonBERT uses codons as inputs which enables it to learn better representations. CodonBERT was trained using more than 10 million mRNA sequences from a diverse set of organisms. The resulting model captures important biological concepts. CodonBERT can also be extended to perform prediction tasks for various mRNA properties. CodonBERT outperforms previous mRNA prediction methods including on a new flu vaccine dataset.},

	abstract = {In light of the rapid accumulation of large-scale omics datasets, numerous studies have attempted to characterize the molecular and clinical features of cancers from a multi-omics perspective. However, there are great challenges in integrating multi-omics using machine learning methods for cancer subtype classification. In this study, MoGCN, a multi-omics integration model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) was developed for cancer subtype classification and analysis. Genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics datasets for 511 breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) samples were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The autoencoder (AE) and the similarity network fusion (SNF) methods were used to reduce dimensionality and construct the patient similarity network (PSN), respectively. Then the vector features and the PSN were input into the GCN for training and testing. Feature extraction and network visualization were used for further biological knowledge discovery and subtype classification. In the analysis of multi-dimensional omics data of the BRCA samples in TCGA, MoGCN achieved the highest accuracy in cancer subtype classification compared with several popular algorithms. Moreover, MoGCN can extract the most significant features of each omics layer and provide candidate functional molecules for further analysis of their biological effects. And network visualization showed that MoGCN could make clinically intuitive diagnosis. The generality of MoGCN was proven on the TCGA pan-kidney cancer datasets. MoGCN and datasets are public available at https://github.com/Lifoof/MoGCN. Our study shows that MoGCN performs well for heterogeneous data integration and the interpretability of classification results, which confers great potential for applications in biomarker identification and clinical diagnosis.},

Moreover, existing GFMs are constrained by rigid output formats, limiting their applicability to various genomic tasks. In this work, we revisit the transformer-based auto-regressive models and introduce Omni-DNA, a family of cross-modal multi-task models ranging from 20 million to 1 billion parameters. Our approach consists of two stages: (i) pretraining on DNA sequences with next token prediction objective, and (ii) expanding the multi-modal task-specific tokens and finetuning for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously. When evaluated on the Nucleotide Transformer and GB benchmarks, Omni-DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 18 out of 26 tasks. Through multi-task finetuning, Omni-DNA addresses 10 acetylation and methylation tasks at once, surpassing models trained on each task individually. Finally, we design two complex genomic tasks, DNA2Function and Needle-in-DNA, which map DNA sequences to textual functional descriptions and images, respectively, indicating Omni-DNA's cross-modal capabilities to broaden the scope of genomic applications.

However, in the lack of an unbiased whole-genome truth set, the global error rate of variant calls and the leading causal artifacts still remain unclear even given the great efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods. Results: We made ten SNP and INDEL call sets with two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid human genome and a diploid genome at a similar coverage. By investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid genome, we identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions and the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as the two major sources of errors, which press for continued improvements in these two areas. We estimated that the error rate of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in 10-15kb, but the error rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100-200kb without significant compromise on the sensitivity.

	abstract = {Here the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium presents a first draft of the human pangenome reference. The pangenome contains 47 phased, diploid assemblies from a cohort of genetically diverse individuals1. These assemblies cover more than 99\% of the expected sequence in each genome and are more than 99\% accurate at the structural and base pair levels. Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. We also add 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90 million of the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced small variant discovery errors by 34\% and increased the number of structural variants detected per haplotype by 104\% compared with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample.},

While language models trained on protein sequences have been studied at a smaller scale, little is known about what they learn about biology as they are scaled up. In this work we train models up to 15 billion parameters, the largest language models of proteins to be evaluated to date. We find that as models are scaled they learn information enabling the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. We present ESMFold for high accuracy end-to-end atomic level structure prediction directly from the individual sequence of a protein. ESMFold has similar accuracy to AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold for sequences with low perplexity that are well understood by the language model. ESMFold inference is an order of magnitude faster than AlphaFold2, enabling exploration of the structural space of metagenomic proteins in practical timescales.},

However, current tools do not predict RNA-seq expression profiles because of modeling challenges. Here, we introduce Borzoi, a model that learns to predict cell-type-specific and tissue-specific RNA-seq coverage from DNA sequence. Using statistics derived from Borzoi’s predicted coverage, we isolate and accurately score DNA variant effects across multiple layers of regulation, including transcription, splicing and polyadenylation. Evaluated on quantitative trait loci, Borzoi is competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on individual regulatory functions. By applying attribution methods to the derived statistics, we extract cis-regulatory motifs driving RNA expression and post-transcriptional regulation in normal tissues. The wide availability of RNA-seq data across species, conditions and assays profiling specific aspects of regulation emphasizes the potential of this approach to decipher the mapping from DNA sequence to regulatory function.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments—the use of “negative controls”—is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

	abstract = {The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.},

We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter).

Pharmacogenetic testing is not widely used in routine clinical practice to optimize drug choice or clinical management.1 This gap between scientific knowledge and clinical application may be explained by the fact that the successful incorporation of a pharmacogenetic test into routine practice requires a combination of high-level evidence that can be generalized to diverse clinical settings, widespread availability of cost-effective and reliable laboratory tests, and effective strategies to incorporate testing into routine clinical practice.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous noncoding variants associated with complex human diseases, disorders, and traits. However, resolving the uncertainty between GWAS association and causality remains a significant challenge. The small subset of noncoding GWAS variants with causative effects on gene regulatory elements can only be detected through accurate methods that assess the impact of DNA sequence variation on gene regulatory activity. Deep learning models, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, have gained prominence in predicting the regulatory effects of genetic variants, particularly in enhancers, by learning patterns from genomic and epigenomic data. Despite their potential, selecting the most suitable model is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks, consistent training conditions, and performance evaluation criteria in existing reviews.
RESULTS: This study evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning models for predicting the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity using nine datasets stemming from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL experiments, profiling the regulatory impact of 54,859 SNPs across four human cell lines. The results reveal that CNN models, such as TREDNet and SEI, consistently outperform other architectures in predicting the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, hybrid CNN-transformer models, such as Borzoi, display superior performance in identifying causal SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block. While fine-tuning enhances the performance of transformer-based models, it remains insufficient to surpass CNN and hybrid models when evaluated under optimized conditions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become increasingly popular to identify associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypic traits. The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses.
METHODS: We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA\_tutorial/). In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual-level scores of genetic risk.
RESULTS: The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands-on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users.
CONCLUSIONS: By providing theoretical background and hands-on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.},

While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features.

	abstract = {Methods for genetic risk prediction have been widely investigated in recent years. However, most available training data involves European samples, and it is currently unclear how to accurately predict disease risk in other populations. Previous studies have used either training data from European samples in large sample size or training data from the target population in small sample size, but not both. Here, we introduce a multiethnic polygenic risk score that combines training data from European samples and training data from the target population. We applied this approach to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a Latino cohort using both publicly available European summary statistics in large sample size (Neff = 40k) and Latino training data in small sample size (Neff = 8k). Here, we attained a {\textgreater}70\% relative improvement in prediction accuracy (from R2 = 0.027 to 0.047) compared to methods that use only one source of training data, consistent with large relative improvements in simulations. We observed a systematically lower load of T2D risk alleles in Latino individuals with more European ancestry, which could be explained by polygenic selection in ancestral European and/or Native American populations. We predict T2D in a South Asian UK Biobank cohort using European (Neff = 40k) and South Asian (Neff = 16k) training data and attained a {\textgreater}70\% relative improvement in prediction accuracy, and application to predict height in an African UK Biobank cohort using European (N = 113k) and African (N = 2k) training data attained a 30\% relative improvement. Our work reduces the gap in polygenic risk prediction accuracy between European and non-European target populations.},

However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation of PRS is that those available today are several times more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric biases in genome-wide association studies, thus highlighting that—unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations—clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement for European-descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in leveling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date. To realize the full and equitable potential of PRS, greater diversity must be prioritized in genetic studies, and summary statistics must be publically disseminated to ensure that health disparities are not increased for those individuals already most underserved.},

	abstract = {Stratification of women according to their risk of breast cancer based on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) could improve screening and prevention strategies. Our aim was to develop PRSs, optimized for prediction of estrogen receptor (ER)-specific disease, from the largest available genome-wide association dataset and to empirically validate the PRSs in prospective studies. The development dataset comprised 94,075 case subjects and 75,017 control subjects of European ancestry from 69 studies, divided into training and validation sets. Samples were genotyped using genome-wide arrays, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected by stepwise regression or lasso penalized regression. The best performing PRSs were validated in an independent test set comprising 11,428 case subjects and 18,323 control subjects from 10 prospective studies and 190,040 women from UK Biobank (3,215 incident breast cancers). For the best PRSs (313 SNPs), the odds ratio for overall disease per 1 standard deviation in ten prospective studies was 1.61 (95\%CI: 1.57–1.65) with area under receiver-operator curve (AUC) = 0.630 (95\%CI: 0.628–0.651). The lifetime risk of overall breast cancer in the top centile of the PRSs was 32.6\%. Compared with women in the middle quintile, those in the highest 1\% of risk had 4.37- and 2.78-fold risks, and those in the lowest 1\% of risk had 0.16- and 0.27-fold risks, of developing ER-positive and ER-negative disease, respectively. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that this PRS was well calibrated and predicts disease risk accurately in the tails of the distribution. This PRS is a powerful and reliable predictor of breast cancer risk that may improve breast cancer prevention programs.},

	abstract = {Genomic variation underlies human phenotypic diversity, disease susceptibility, and evolutionary adaptation. Although large-scale genomic sequencing has transformed our ability to map genetic variation, accurately modeling and interpreting this data remains challenging due to fundamental limitations in existing genomic foundation models (GFMs). Current genomic models typically treat DNA simplistically as linear textual sequences, overlooking critical biological context, such as genomic structural annotations, regulatory elements, and functional contexts central to genomic interpretation. As a result, these models are prone to positional memorization of common sequences, severely limiting their generalization to biologically meaningful tasks. Here, we introduce BioToken, a modular and extendable tokenization framework designed to encode genomic variants and biologically relevant structural annotations directly into genomic representations. By utilizing intrinsic inductive biases, BioToken facilitates meaningful representation learning and generalization across diverse molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, alternative splicing, and variant pathogenicity prediction. Built on BioToken, our genomic foundation model, BioFM, achieves competitive or superior results relative to specialized models (e.g., Enformer, SpliceTransformer) across a comprehensive suite of genomic benchmarks, including noncoding pathogenicity, expression modulation, sQTL prediction, and long-range genomic interactions. Notably, BioFM achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters (265M), substantially reducing training costs and computational requirements. Our findings high-light the substantial advantages of integrating biologically-informed inductive biases into genomic foundation modeling, providing a robust and accessible path forward in genomics. We provide our code and model checkpoints to support further research in this direction.},

	abstract = {Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive genome annotation is essential to understand the impact of clinically relevant variants. However, the absence of a standard for clinical reporting and browser display complicates the process of consistent interpretation and reporting. To address these challenges, Ensembl/GENCODE1 and RefSeq2 launched a joint initiative, the Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) collaboration, to converge on human gene and transcript annotation and to jointly define a high-value set of transcripts and corresponding proteins. Here, we describe the MANE transcript sets for use as universal standards for variant reporting and browser display. The MANE Select set identifies a representative transcript for each human protein-coding gene, whereas the MANE Plus Clinical set provides additional transcripts at loci where the Select transcripts alone are not sufficient to report all currently known clinical variants. Each MANE transcript represents an exact match between the exonic sequences of an Ensembl/GENCODE transcript and its counterpart in RefSeq such that the identifiers can be used synonymously. We have now released MANE Select transcripts for 97\% of human protein-coding genes, including all American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Secondary Findings list v3.0 (ref. 3) genes. MANE transcripts are accessible from major genome browsers and key resources. Widespread adoption of these transcript sets will increase the consistency of reporting, facilitate the exchange of data regardless of the annotation source and help to streamline clinical interpretation.},

	abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

In the present study, we present an open resource that provides systematic fine mapping and gene prioritization across 133,441 published human GWAS loci. We integrate genetics (GWAS Catalog and UK Biobank) with transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic data, including systematic disease–disease and disease–molecular trait colocalization results across 92 cell types and tissues. We identify 729 loci fine mapped to a single-coding causal variant and colocalized with a single gene. We trained a machine-learning model using the fine-mapped genetics and functional genomics data and 445 gold-standard curated GWAS loci to distinguish causal genes from neighboring genes, outperforming a naive distance-based model. Our prioritized genes were enriched for known approved drug targets (odds ratio = 8.1, 95\% confidence interval = 5.7, 11.5). These results are publicly available through a web portal (http://genetics.opentargets.org), enabling users to easily prioritize genes at disease-associated loci and assess their potential as drug targets.},

	abstract = {In the canonical genetic code, many amino acids are assigned more than one codon. Work by us and others has shown that the choice of these synonymous codon is not random, and carries regulatory and functional consequences. Existing protein foundation models ignore this context-dependent role of coding sequence in shaping the protein landscape of the cell. To address this gap, we introduce cdsFM, a suite of codon-resolution large language models, including both EnCodon and DeCodon models, with up to 1B parameters. Pre-trained on 60 million protein-coding sequences from more than 5,000 species, our models effectively learn the relationship between codons and amino acids, recapitualing the overall structure of the genetic code. In addition to outperforming state-of-the-art genomic foundation models in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, the larger pre-trained models were superior in predicting the choice of synonymous codons. To systematically assess the impact of synonymous codon choices on protein expression and our models’ ability to capture these effects, we generated a large dataset measuring overall and surface expression levels of three proteins as a function of changes in their synonymous codons. We showed that our EnCodon models could be readily fine-tuned to predict the contextual consequences of synonymous codon choices. Armed with this knowledge, we applied EnCodon to existing clinical datasets of synonymous variants, and we identified a large number of synonymous codons that are likely pathogenic, several of which we experimentally confirmed in a cellbased model. Together, our findings establish the cdsFM suite as a powerful tool for decoding the complex functional grammar underlying the choice of synonymous codons.},

	abstract = {Rare diseases, an emerging global public health priority, require an evidence-based estimate of the global point prevalence to inform public policy. We used the publicly available epidemiological data in the Orphanet database to calculate such a prevalence estimate. Overall, Orphanet contains information on 6172 unique rare diseases; 71.9\% of which are genetic and 69.9\% which are exclusively pediatric onset. Global point prevalence was calculated using rare disease prevalence data for predefined geographic regions from the ‘Orphanet Epidemiological file’ (http://www.orphadata.org/cgi-bin/epidemio.html). Of the 5304 diseases defined by point prevalence, 84.5\% of those analysed have a point prevalence of {\textless}1/1 000 000. However 77.3–80.7\% of the population burden of rare diseases is attributable to the 4.2\% (n = 149) diseases in the most common prevalence range (1–5 per 10 000). Consequently national definitions of ‘Rare Diseases’ (ranging from prevalence of 5 to 80 per 100 000) represent a variable number of rare disease patients despite sharing the majority of rare disease in their scope. Our analysis yields a conservative, evidence-based estimate for the population prevalence of rare diseases of 3.5–5.9\%, which equates to 263–446 million persons affected globally at any point in time. This figure is derived from data from 67.6\% of the prevalent rare diseases; using the European definition of 5 per 10 000; and excluding rare cancers, infectious diseases, and poisonings. Future registry research and the implementation of rare disease codification in healthcare systems will further refine the estimates.},

	abstract = {Genomic (DNA) sequences encode an enormous amount of information for gene regulation and protein synthesis. Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context ({\textless}0.001\% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers or fixed k-mers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyena's new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level - an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics. On fine-tuned benchmarks from the Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA reaches state-of-the-art (SotA) on 12 of 18 datasets using a model with orders of magnitude less parameters and pretraining data. On the GenomicBenchmarks, HyenaDNA surpasses SotA on 7 of 8 datasets on average by +10 accuracy points. Code at https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna.},

Many of these cohorts, however, are small, lack diversity, or do not provide comprehensive phenotype data. The All of Us Research Program plans to enroll a diverse group of at least 1 million persons in the United States in order to accelerate biomedical research and improve health. The program aims to make the research results accessible to participants, and it is developing new approaches to generate, access, and make data broadly available to approved researchers. All of Us opened for enrollment in May 2018 and currently enrolls participants 18 years of age or older from a network of more than 340 recruitment sites. Elements of the program protocol include health questionnaires, electronic health records (EHRs), physical measurements, the use of digital health technology, and the collection and analysis of biospecimens. As of July 2019, more than 175,000 participants had contributed biospecimens. More than 80\% of these participants are from groups that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research. EHR data on more than 112,000 participants from 34 sites have been collected. The All of Us data repository should permit researchers to take into account individual differences in lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, environment, and biologic characteristics in order to advance precision diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The U.S. research cohort All of Us was announced in 2015 and launched last year. With more than one fifth of the target enrollment now completed, the investigators report on progress and challenges.},

	abstract = {Many existing cohorts contain a range of relatedness between genotyped individuals, either by design or by chance. Haplotype estimation in such cohorts is a central step in many downstream analyses. Using genotypes from six cohorts from isolated populations and two cohorts from non-isolated populations, we have investigated the performance of different phasing methods designed for nominally ‘unrelated’ individuals. We find that SHAPEIT2 produces much lower switch error rates in all cohorts compared to other methods, including those designed specifically for isolated populations. In particular, when large amounts of IBD sharing is present, SHAPEIT2 infers close to perfect haplotypes. Based on these results we have developed a general strategy for phasing cohorts with any level of implicit or explicit relatedness between individuals. First SHAPEIT2 is run ignoring all explicit family information. We then apply a novel HMM method (duoHMM) to combine the SHAPEIT2 haplotypes with any family information to infer the inheritance pattern of each meiosis at all sites across each chromosome. This allows the correction of switch errors, detection of recombination events and genotyping errors. We show that the method detects numbers of recombination events that align very well with expectations based on genetic maps, and that it infers far fewer spurious recombination events than Merlin. The method can also detect genotyping errors and infer recombination events in otherwise uninformative families, such as trios and duos. The detected recombination events can be used in association scans for recombination phenotypes. The method provides a simple and unified approach to haplotype estimation, that will be of interest to researchers in the fields of human, animal and plant genetics.},

In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

	abstract = {Missense variants remain a challenge in genetic interpretation owing to their subtle and context-dependent effects. Although current prediction models perform well in known disease genes, their scores are not calibrated across the proteome, limiting generalizability. To address this knowledge gap, we developed popEVE, a deep generative model combining evolutionary and human population data to estimate variant deleteriousness on a proteome-wide scale. popEVE achieves state-of-the-art performance without overestimating the burden of deleterious variants and identifies variants in 442 genes in a severe developmental disorder cohort, including 123 novel candidates. These genes are functionally similar to known disease genes, and their variants often localize to critical regions. Remarkably, popEVE can prioritize likely causal variants using only child exomes, enabling diagnosis even without parental sequencing. This work provides a generalizable framework for rare disease variant interpretation, especially in singleton cases, and demonstrates the utility of calibrated, evolution-informed scoring models for clinical genomics.},

	abstract = {Objective: Our aim was to review empirical studies of complacency and bias in human interaction with automated and decision support systems and provide an integrated theoretical model for their explanation.
Background: Automation-related complacency and automation bias have typically been considered separately and independently.
Methods: Studies on complacency and automation bias were analyzed with respect to the cognitive processes involved.
Results: Automation complacency occurs under conditions of multiple-task load, when manual tasks compete with the automated task for the operator’s attention. Automation complacency is found in both naive and expert participants and cannot be overcome with simple practice. Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect.Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams.While automation bias has been conceived of as a special case of decision bias, our analysis suggests that it also depends on attentional processes similar to those involved in automation-related complacency.
Conclusion: Complacency and automation bias represent different manifestations of overlapping automation-induced phenomena, with attention playing a central role. An integrated model of complacency and automation bias shows that they result from the dynamic interaction of personal, situational, and automation-related characteristics.
Application: The integrated model and attentional synthesis provides a heuristic framework for further research on complacency and automation bias and design options for mitigating such effects in automated and decision support systems.},

We also uncover a general “phase change” phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

TranscriptFormer jointly models genes and transcripts using a novel generative architecture, enabling it to function as a virtual instrument for probing cellular biology. In zero-shot settings, our models demonstrate superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cell type classification, with robust performance even for species separated by over 685 million years of evolutionary distance. TranscriptFormer can also perform zero-shot disease state identification in human cells and accurately transfers cell type annotations across species boundaries. Being a generative model, TranscriptFormer can be prompted to predict cell type-specific transcription factors and gene-gene interactions that align with independent experimental observations.

	abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

Rather than each study engaging in independent evaluation of significance standards, we have undertaken the task of developing such standards for genomewide significance, based on data collected by the International Haplotype Map Consortium. We report an estimated testing burden of a million independent tests genomewide in Europeans, and twice that number in Africans.

	abstract = {Recommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) for interpreting sequence variants specify the use of computational predictors as "supporting" level of evidence for pathogenicity or benignity using criteria PP3 and BP4, respectively. However, score intervals defined by tool developers, and ACMG/AMP recommendations that require the consensus of multiple predictors, lack quantitative support. Previously, we described a probabilistic framework that quantified the strengths of evidence (supporting, moderate, strong, very strong) within ACMG/AMP recommendations. We have extended this framework to computational predictors and introduce a new standard that converts a tool's scores to PP3 and BP4 evidence strengths. Our approach is based on estimating the local positive predictive value and can calibrate any computational tool or other continuous-scale evidence on any variant type. We estimate thresholds (score intervals) corresponding to each strength of evidence for pathogenicity and benignity for thirteen missense variant interpretation tools, using carefully assembled independent data sets. Most tools achieved supporting evidence level for both pathogenic and benign classification using newly established thresholds. Multiple tools reached score thresholds justifying moderate and several reached strong evidence levels. One tool reached very strong evidence level for benign classification on some variants. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for evidence-based revisions of the PP3 and BP4 ACMG/AMP criteria using individual tools and future assessment of computational methods for clinical interpretation.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers at scale, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In challenging reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-space models, transfer functions, and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets WikiText103 and The Pile, reaching Transformer quality with a 20\% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2k. Hyena operators are 2x faster than highly optimized attention at sequence length 8k, with speedups of 100x at 64k.},

We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11\% faster and using 11\% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.},

	abstract = {Summary: Annotating genetic variants, especially non-coding variants, for the purpose of identifying pathogenic variants remains a challenge. Combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) is an algorithm designed to annotate both coding and non-coding variants, and has been shown to outperform other annotation algorithms. CADD trains a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate evolutionarily derived, likely benign, alleles from simulated, likely deleterious, variants. However, SVMs cannot capture non-linear relationships among the features, which can limit performance. To address this issue, we have developed DANN. DANN uses the same feature set and training data as CADD to train a deep neural network (DNN). DNNs can capture non-linear relationships among features and are better suited than SVMs for problems with a large number of samples and features. We exploit Compute Unified Device Architecture-compatible graphics processing units and deep learning techniques such as dropout and momentum training to accelerate the DNN training. DANN achieves about a 19\% relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14\% relative increase in the area under the curve (AUC) metric over CADD’s SVM methodology.Availability and implementation: All data and source code are available at https://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public\_data/DANN/.Contact:  xhx@ics.uci.edu},

This task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of function. A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational research because over 98\% of the human genome is non-coding and 93\% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network framework for predicting non-coding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory ‘grammar’ to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably upon other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50\% relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models.

	abstract = {Identifying causal genetic variants in a computational manner remains an open problem. Training end-to-end prediction models is not possible without large ground-truth datasets, while results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are entangled by linkage disequilibrium (LD), and gene expression datasets do not contain genetic variation at individual-level. Here, we propose Multiple Instance Fine-mapping (MIFM) – a multiple instance learning (MIL) objective to overcome the lack of strong labels by grouping putatively causal variants together based on their LD scores. Using MIFM, we trained a deep classifier on a dataset aggregating over 13, 000 GWAS to predict causal variants based on their underlying DNA sequences. We validated variants prioritized by MIFM by constructing polygenic risk scores which transferred better to different target ancestries. Furthermore, we demonstrated how MIFM can be used to disentangle effect sizes of highly-correlated variants to better fine-map GWAS results.
Author summary Genome-wide association studies have identified tens of thousands genetic variants associated with traits or diseases. However, the majority of identified variants is only spuriously correlated with the phenotype of interest, having no causal effect on it. Instead, these variants are often inherited together with nearby biologically causal variants, thus creating the spurious associations. Fine-mapping, i.e., predicting which variants are causal, is crucial for downstream tasks, such as uncovering the biological mechanisms affecting the phenotype or robustly identifying individuals with high genetic risk of a disease. While most fine-mapping methods are based on the available association statistics or functional annotations of genetic regions, it should be possible to identify causal variants based on their neighboring DNA sequences. However, training a standard machine learning classifier for that task is obstructed by the scarcity of strong, ground-truth labels. Here, we proposed a method to train sequence models predicting variant causality using weakly-labeled data. We trained a model on a large set of associated variants, and demonstrated its utility by improving cross-ancestry predictions of genetic risk, or disentangling the effect sizes of highly correlated variants.},

Semi-supervised learning has emerged as an important paradigm in protein modeling due to the high cost of acquiring supervised protein labels, but the current literature is fragmented when it comes to datasets and standardized evaluation techniques. To facilitate progress in this field, we introduce the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings (TAPE), a set of five biologically relevant semi-supervised learning tasks spread across different domains of protein biology. We curate tasks into specific training, validation, and test splits to ensure that each task tests biologically relevant generalization that transfers to real-life scenarios. We benchmark a range of approaches to semi-supervised protein representation learning, which span recent work as well as canonical sequence learning techniques. We find that self-supervised pretraining is helpful for almost all models on all tasks, more than doubling performance in some cases. Despite this increase, in several cases features learned by self-supervised pretraining still lag behind features extracted by state-of-the-art non-neural techniques. This gap in performance suggests a huge opportunity for innovative architecture design and improved modeling paradigms that better capture the signal in biological sequences. TAPE will help the machine learning community focus effort on scientifically relevant problems.

To date, CPIC has published 23 guidelines (of which 11 have been updated), covering 19 genes and 46 drugs across several therapeutic areas. CPIC also now provides additional resources to facilitate the implementation of pharmacogenetics into routine clinical practice and the electronic health record. Furthermore, since its inception, CPIC's interactions with other resources, databases, websites, and genomic communities have grown.

	abstract = {Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a widely used measure of variant deleteriousness that can effectively prioritize causal variants in genetic analyses, particularly highly penetrant contributors to severe Mendelian disorders. CADD is an integrative annotation built from more than 60 genomic features, and can score human single nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions anywhere in the reference assembly. CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection. Here we review the latest updates to CADD, including the most recent version, 1.4, which supports the human genome build GRCh38. We also present updates to our website that include simplified variant lookup, extended documentation, an Application Program Interface and improved mechanisms for integrating CADD scores into other tools or applications.

	abstract = {Disclaimer: These ACMG Standards and Guidelines were developed primarily as an educational resource for clinical laboratory geneticists to help them provide quality clinical laboratory services. Adherence to these standards and guidelines is voluntary and does not necessarily assure a successful medical outcome. These Standards and Guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper procedures and tests or exclusive of other procedures and tests that are reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test, the clinical laboratory geneticist should apply his or her own professional judgment to the specific circumstances presented by the individual patient or specimen. Clinical laboratory geneticists are encouraged to document in the patient’s record the rationale for the use of a particular procedure or test, whether or not it is in conformance with these Standards and Guidelines. They also are advised to take notice of the date any particular guideline was adopted and to consider other relevant medical and scientific information that becomes available after that date. It also would be prudent to consider whether intellectual property interests may restrict the performance of certain tests and other procedures. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) previously developed guidance for the interpretation of sequence variants.1 In the past decade, sequencing technology has evolved rapidly with the advent of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. By adopting and leveraging next-generation sequencing, clinical laboratories are now performing an ever-increasing catalogue of genetic testing spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders. By virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has been accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. In this context the ACMG convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising representatives from the ACMG, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and the College of American Pathologists to revisit and revise the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. The group consisted of clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. This report represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from ACMG, AMP, and College of American Pathologists stakeholders. These recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. This report recommends the use of specific standard terminology—“pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely benign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified in genes that cause Mendelian disorders. Moreover, this recommendation describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data). Because of the increased complexity of analysis and interpretation of clinical genetic testing described in this report, the ACMG strongly recommends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–approved laboratory, with results interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or molecular genetic pathologist or the equivalent.

In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},

This region is the most polymorphic region of the human genome, and the levels of polymorphism seen exceed most other genes. Some of the genes have several thousand variants and are now termed hyperpolymorphic, rather than just simply polymorphic. The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database has provided a stable, highly accessible, user-friendly repository for this information, providing the scientific and medical community access to the many variant sequences of this gene system, that are critical for the successful outcome of transplantation. The number of currently known variants, and dramatic increase in the number of new variants being identified has necessitated a dedicated resource with custom tools for curation and publication. The challenge for the database is to continue to provide a highly curated database of sequence variants, while supporting the increased number of submissions and complexity of sequences. In order to do this, traditional methods of accessing and presenting data will be challenged, and new methods will need to be utilized to keep pace with new discoveries.},

Recent efforts to level ancestry imbalance in genomic research have expanded the scale of non-European GWAS, although most remain underpowered. Here, we present a new PRS construction method, PRS-CSx, which improves cross-population polygenic prediction by integrating GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations. PRS-CSx couples genetic effects across populations via a shared continuous shrinkage (CS) prior, enabling more accurate effect size estimation by sharing information between summary statistics and leveraging linkage disequilibrium diversity across discovery samples, while inheriting computational efficiency and robustness from PRS-CS. We show that PRS-CSx outperforms alternative methods across traits with a wide range of genetic architectures, cross-population genetic overlaps and discovery GWAS sample sizes in simulations, and improves the prediction of quantitative traits and schizophrenia risk in non-European populations.},

We demonstrate its remarkable performance across different coverages and human populations. GLIMPSE achieves imputation of a genome for less than US\$1 in computational cost, considerably outperforming other methods and improving imputation accuracy over the full allele frequency range. As a proof of concept, we show that 1× coverage enables effective gene expression association studies and outperforms dense SNP arrays in rare variant burden tests. Overall, this study illustrates the promising potential of low-coverage imputation and suggests a paradigm shift in the design of future genomic studies.},

HLA imputation has been used to define causal variation in autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, and in human immunodeficiency virus infection control. However, there are few guidelines on performing HLA imputation, association testing, and fine mapping. Here, we present a comprehensive tutorial to impute HLA alleles from genotype data. We provide detailed guidance on performing standard quality control measures for input genotyping data and describe options to impute HLA alleles and amino acids either locally or using the web-based Michigan Imputation Server, which hosts a multi-ancestry HLA imputation reference panel. We also offer best practice recommendations to conduct association tests to define the alleles, amino acids, and haplotypes that affect human traits. Along with the pipeline, we provide a step-by-step online guide with scripts and available software (https://github.com/immunogenomics/HLA\_analyses\_tutorial).

Together with a genetic algorithm, we use the model to engineer new 5′ UTRs that accurately direct specified levels of ribosome loading, providing the ability to tune sequences for optimal protein expression. We show that the same approach can be extended to chemically modified RNA, an important feature for applications in mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology.

We established byte-pair encoding on the human genome and trained a foundation language model called GROVER (Genome Rules Obtained Via Extracted Representations) with the vocabulary selected via a custom task, next-k-mer prediction. The defined dictionary of tokens in the human genome carries best the information content for GROVER. Analysing learned representations, we observed that trained token embeddings primarily encode information related to frequency, sequence content and length. Some tokens are primarily localized in repeats, whereas the majority widely distribute over the genome. GROVER also learns context and lexical ambiguity. Average trained embeddings of genomic regions relate to functional genomics annotation and thus indicate learning of these structures purely from the contextual relationships of tokens. This highlights the extent of information content encoded by the sequence that can be grasped by GROVER. On fine-tuning tasks addressing genome biology with questions of genome element identification and protein–DNA binding, GROVER exceeds other models’ performance. GROVER learns sequence context, a sense for structure and language rules. Extracting this knowledge can be used to compose a grammar book for the code of life.},

However, modeling genomic sequences introduces challenges such as the need to model long-range token interactions, the effects of upstream and downstream regions of the genome, and the reverse complementarity (RC) of DNA. Here, we propose an architecture motivated by these challenges that builds off the long-range Mamba block, and extends it to a BiMamba component that supports bi-directionality, and to a MambaDNA block that additionally supports RC equivariance. We use MambaDNA as the basis of Caduceus, the first family of RC equivariant bi-directional long-range DNA language models, and we introduce pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that yield Caduceus DNA foundation models. Caduceus outperforms previous long-range models on downstream benchmarks; on a challenging long-range variant effect prediction task, Caduceus exceeds the performance of 10x larger models that do not leverage bi-directionality or equivariance.},

Here, we present our most recent release, CADD v1.7. We explored and integrated new annotation features, among them state-of-the-art protein language model scores (Meta ESM-1v), regulatory variant effect predictions (from sequence-based convolutional neural networks) and sequence conservation scores (Zoonomia). We evaluated the new version on data sets derived from ClinVar, ExAC/gnomAD and 1000 Genomes variants. For coding effects, we tested CADD on 31 Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) data sets from ProteinGym and, for regulatory effect prediction, we used saturation mutagenesis reporter assay data of promoter and enhancer sequences. The inclusion of new features further improved the overall performance of CADD. As with previous releases, all data sets, genome-wide CADD v1.7 scores, scripts for on-site scoring and an easy-to-use webserver are readily provided via https://cadd.bihealth.org/ or https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/ to the community.},

Third-generation nanopore sequence data have demonstrated a long read length, but current interpretation methods for their novel pore-based signal have unique error profiles, making accurate analysis challenging. Here, we introduce a haplotype-aware variant calling pipeline, PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant, that produces state-of-the-art variant calling results with nanopore data. We show that our nanopore-based method outperforms the short-read-based single-nucleotide-variant identification method at the whole-genome scale and produces high-quality single-nucleotide variants in segmental duplications and low-mappability regions where short-read-based genotyping fails. We show that our pipeline can provide highly contiguous phase blocks across the genome with nanopore reads, contiguously spanning between 85\% and 92\% of annotated genes across six samples. We also extend PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant to PacBio HiFi data, providing an efficient solution with superior performance over the current WhatsHap-DeepVariant standard. Finally, we demonstrate de novo assembly polishing methods that use nanopore and PacBio HiFi reads to produce diploid assemblies with high accuracy (Q35+ nanopore-polished and Q40+ PacBio HiFi-polished).},

	abstract = {Structured access is an emerging paradigm for the safe deployment of artificial intelligence (AI). Instead of openly disseminating AI systems, developers facilitate controlled, arm's length interactions with their AI systems. The aim is to prevent dangerous AI capabilities from being widely accessible, whilst preserving access to AI capabilities that can be used safely. The developer must both restrict how the AI system can be used, and prevent the user from circumventing these restrictions through modification or reverse engineering of the AI system. Structured access is most effective when implemented through cloud-based AI services, rather than disseminating AI software that runs locally on users' hardware. Cloud-based interfaces provide the AI developer greater scope for controlling how the AI system is used, and for protecting against unauthorized modifications to the system's design. This chapter expands the discussion of "publication norms" in the AI community, which to date has focused on the question of how the informational content of AI research projects should be disseminated (e.g., code and models). Although this is an important question, there are limits to what can be achieved through the control of information flows. Structured access views AI software not only as information that can be shared but also as a tool with which users can have arm's length interactions. There are early examples of structured access being practiced by AI developers, but there is much room for further development, both in the functionality of cloud-based interfaces and in the wider institutional framework.},

Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its `reference activation’ and assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLIFT to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show significant advantages over gradient-based methods.

	abstract = {We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%-8\% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18\%-37\%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47\%-68\%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.},

Furthermore, Sniffles2 solves the problem of family-level to population-level SV calling to produce fully genotyped VCF files. Across 11 probands, we accurately identified causative SVs around MECP2, including highly complex alleles with three overlapping SVs. Sniffles2 also enables the detection of mosaic SVs in bulk long-read data. As a result, we identified multiple mosaic SVs in brain tissue from a patient with multiple system atrophy. The identified SV showed a remarkable diversity within the cingulate cortex, impacting both genes involved in neuron function and repetitive elements.},

However, these models may also confer easy access to dual-use technologies capable of inflicting great harm. To evaluate this risk, the 'Safeguarding the Future' course at MIT tasked non-scientist students with investigating whether LLM chatbots could be prompted to assist non-experts in causing a pandemic. In one hour, the chatbots suggested four potential pandemic pathogens, explained how they can be generated from synthetic DNA using reverse genetics, supplied the names of DNA synthesis companies unlikely to screen orders, identified detailed protocols and how to troubleshoot them, and recommended that anyone lacking the skills to perform reverse genetics engage a core facility or contract research organization. Collectively, these results suggest that LLMs will make pandemic-class agents widely accessible as soon as they are credibly identified, even to people with little or no laboratory training. Promising nonproliferation measures include pre-release evaluations of LLMs by third parties, curating training datasets to remove harmful concepts, and verifiably screening all DNA generated by synthesis providers or used by contract research organizations and robotic cloud laboratories to engineer organisms or viruses.},

The scope of the repository has expanded to include additional data types of high interest to the community, including sequencing-based GWAS, gene-based analyses and copy number variation analyses. Community outreach has increased the number of shared datasets from under-represented traits, e.g. cancer, and we continue to contribute to awareness of the lack of population diversity in GWAS. Interoperability of the Catalog has been enhanced through links to other resources including the Polygenic Score Catalog and the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, refinements to GWAS trait annotation, and the development of a standard format for GWAS data.},

	abstract = {Position encoding has recently been shown to be effective in transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in the self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\_doc/roformer.},

We compared phyloP scores to genome annotation, association studies, copy-number variation, clinical genetics findings, and cancer data. Constrained positions are enriched for variants that explain common disease heritability more than other functional annotations.

We identify two fundamental axioms—Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Redundant protein sequences in biological databases hinder sequence similarity searches and make interpretation of search results difficult. Clustering of protein sequence space based on sequence similarity helps organize all sequences into manageable datasets and reduces sampling bias and overrepresentation of sequences.Results: The UniRef (UniProt Reference Clusters) provide clustered sets of sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and selected UniProt Archive records to obtain complete coverage of sequence space at several resolutions while hiding redundant sequences. Currently covering \&gt;4 million source sequences, the UniRef100 database combines identical sequences and subfragments from any source organism into a single UniRef entry. UniRef90 and UniRef50 are built by clustering UniRef100 sequences at the 90 or 50\% sequence identity levels. UniRef100, UniRef90 and UniRef50 yield a database size reduction of ∼10, 40 and 70\%, respectively, from the source sequence set. The reduced redundancy increases the speed of similarity searches and improves detection of distant relationships. UniRef entries contain summary cluster and membership information, including the sequence of a representative protein, member count and common taxonomy of the cluster, the accession numbers of all the merged entries and links to rich functional annotation in UniProtKB to facilitate biological discovery. UniRef has already been applied to broad research areas ranging from genome annotation to proteomics data analysis.Availability: UniRef is updated biweekly and is available for online search and retrieval at http://www.uniprot.org, as well as for download at ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/unirefContact:  bes23@georgetown.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

C.Origami enables in silico experiments to examine the impact of genetic changes on chromatin interactions. We further developed an in silico genetic screening approach to assess how individual DNA elements may contribute to chromatin organization and to identify putative cell-type-specific trans-acting regulators that collectively determine chromatin architecture. Applying this approach to leukemia cells and normal T cells, we demonstrate that cell-type-specific in silico genetic screening, enabled by C.Origami, can be used to systematically discover novel chromatin regulation circuits in both normal and disease-related biological systems.},

Building on our manual curation processes, we are introducing new initiatives that allow us to prioritize key genes and diseases, and to react more quickly and comprehensively to new findings in the literature. Alongside improvements to the public website and data-download systems, new functionality in COSMIC-3D allows exploration of mutations within three-dimensional protein structures, their protein structural and functional impacts, and implications for druggability. In parallel with COSMIC’s deep and broad variant coverage, the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) describes a curated catalogue of genes driving every form of human cancer.

	abstract = {Purpose: We evaluated the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) variant pathogenicity guidelines for internal consistency and compatibility with Bayesian statistical reasoning. Methods: The ACMG/AMP criteria were translated into a naive Bayesian classifier, assuming four levels of evidence and exponentially scaled odds of pathogenicity. We tested this framework with a range of prior probabilities and odds of pathogenicity. Results: We modeled the ACMG/AMP guidelines using biologically plausible assumptions. Most ACMG/AMP combining criteria were compatible. One ACMG/AMP likely pathogenic combination was mathematically equivalent to pathogenic and one ACMG/AMP pathogenic combination was actually likely pathogenic. We modeled combinations that include evidence for and against pathogenicity, showing that our approach scored some combinations as pathogenic or likely pathogenic that ACMG/AMP would designate as variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Conclusion: By transforming the ACMG/AMP guidelines into a Bayesian framework, we provide a mathematical foundation for what was a qualitative heuristic. Only 2 of the 18 existing ACMG/AMP evidence combinations were mathematically inconsistent with the overall framework. Mixed combinations of pathogenic and benign evidence could yield a likely pathogenic, likely benign, or VUS result. This quantitative framework validates the approach adopted by the ACMG/AMP, provides opportunities to further refine evidence categories and combining rules, and supports efforts to automate components of variant pathogenicity assessments.},

Recently, transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural language understanding1,2 and computer vision3 by leveraging deep learning models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-tuned towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited task-specific data. Here, we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30 million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Multivariate time-series data are frequently observed in critical care settings and are typically characterized by sparsity (missing information) and irregular time intervals. Existing approaches for learning representations in this domain handle these challenges by either aggregation or imputation of values, which in-turn suppresses the fine-grained information and adds undesirable noise/overhead into the machine learning model. To tackle this problem, we propose a Self-supervised Transformer for Time-Series (STraTS) model, which overcomes these pitfalls by treating time-series as a set of observation triplets instead of using the standard dense matrix representation. It employs a novel Continuous Value Embedding technique to encode continuous time and variable values without the need for discretization. It is composed of a Transformer component with multi-head attention layers, which enable it to learn contextual triplet embeddings while avoiding the problems of recurrence and vanishing gradients that occur in recurrent architectures. In addition, to tackle the problem of limited availability of labeled data (which is typically observed in many healthcare applications), STraTS utilizes self-supervision by leveraging unlabeled data to learn better representations by using time-series forecasting as an auxiliary proxy task. Experiments on real-world multivariate clinical time-series benchmark datasets demonstrate that STraTS has better prediction performance than state-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction, especially when labeled data is limited. Finally, we also present an interpretable version of STraTS, which can identify important measurements in the time-series data.

Early findings, however, revealed a more complex genetic architecture than was anticipated for most common diseases — complexity that seemed to limit the immediate utility of these findings. As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information. Nevertheless, recent efforts have begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify groups of individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease. In this context, we review the evidence supporting the personal and clinical utility of polygenic risk profiling.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R(2) increased from 20.1\% to 25.3\% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8\% to 12.0\% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.},

	abstract = {Heritability, the proportion of variation in a particular trait that is attributable to genetic factors, is a fundamental parameter in genetics. First introduced by Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher nearly a century ago, it is key to the response to selection in evolutionary biology and agriculture, and to the prediction of disease risk in medicine.Heritability is not necessarily constant in a population. Changes in the method of measurement, environmental change and the effects of migration, selection and inbreeding all can alter heritability.The use of high-density genetic marker technologies allows novel estimation methods of heritability, for example, estimation in unpedigreed populations and estimation within families — free of assumptions about variation between families.The estimation of heritability for new phenotypes — those that can be measured with recently developed technologies — provides knowledge about the nature of between-individual differences in core biological processes. For example, amounts of gene expression, brain scanning measurements, the length of telomeres and biochemical compounds measured by mass spectrometry show substantial heritability.Heritabilities are often surprisingly large and at present there is no consensus theory to explain why heritabilities have the values they do. Fortunately, the incredible pace of gene–phenotype discoveries in many species will allow new insights to these questions in the near future.},

	abstract = {Trait-associated genetic variants affect complex phenotypes primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88\% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL (detected for 37\% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13\% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes.},

However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$ to \$O(n)\$ in both time and space.

	abstract = {We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in linear regression, with a particular focus on quantifying uncertainty in which variables should be selected. The approach is based on a new model—the ‘sum of single effects’ model, called ‘SuSiE’—which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of ‘single-effect’ vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure—iterative Bayesian stepwise selection (IBSS)—which is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods but, instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under SuSiE. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a credible set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outperform existing methods for this task, and we illustrate their application to fine mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable-selection problems.},

Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence–structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.},

However, current methods typically focus on individual genomic segments without considering the global genetic architecture. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of performing genome-wide fine-mapping (GWFM) and develop methods to facilitate GWFM. In simulations and real data analyses, GWFM outperforms current methods in error control, mapping power and precision, replication rate, and trans-ancestry phenotype prediction. For 48 well-powered traits in the UK Biobank, we identify causal variants that collectively explain 17\% of the SNP-based heritability, and predict that fine-mapping 50\% of that would require 2 million samples on average. We pinpoint a known causal variant, as proof-of-principle, at FTO for body mass index, unveil a hidden secondary variant with evolutionary conservation, and identify new missense causal variants for schizophrenia and Crohn’s disease. Overall, we analyse 600 complex traits with 13 million SNPs, highlighting the efficacy of GWFM with functional annotations.},

	url = {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/xiong20b.html},
	abstract = {The Transformer is widely used in natural language processing tasks. To train a Transformer however, one usually needs a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage, which is shown to be crucial to the final performance but will slow down the optimization and bring more hyper-parameter tunings. In this paper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is essential and show that the location of layer normalization matters. Specifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful for avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the layer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as Pre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This motivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN Transformers. We show in our experiments that Pre-LN Transformers without the warm-up stage can reach comparable results with baselines while requiring significantly less training time and hyper-parameter tuning on a wide range of applications.},

	abstract = {Large-scale biobanks provide comprehensive electronic health records (EHRs) that capture detailed clinical phenotypes, potentially enhancing disease prediction. However, traditional polygenic risk score (PRS) methods rely on simplified phenotype definitions or predefined trait sets, limiting their ability to represent the complex structures embedded within EHRs. To address this gap, we introduce EHR-embedding-enhanced PRS (EEPRS), leveraging phenotype embeddings derived from EHRs to improve PRSs using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. Employing embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GPT, we conducted EHR-embedding-based GWASs and identified a cardiovascular cluster via hierarchical clustering of genetic correlations. Across 41 traits in the UK Biobank, EEPRS consistently outperformed single-trait PRSs, particularly within this cluster. PRS-based phenome-wide association studies further demonstrated robust associations between EHR-embedding-based PRS and circulatory system diseases. We then developed EEPRS\_optimal, a data-adaptive method that uses cross-validation to select the best embedding, yielding additional improvements. We also developed MTAG\_EEPRS for multi-trait PRSs, which further improved prediction accuracy compared to single-trait PRSs and MTAG\_PRS. Finally, we validated the benefits of EEPRS in the All of Us cohort for seven selected diseases. Overall, EEPRS represents a robust and interpretable framework, enhancing single-trait and multi-trait PRSs by integrating EHR embeddings.},

However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.},

	abstract = {Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are predicted to collectively explain 40–50\% of phenotypic variation in human height, but identifying the specific variants and associated regions requires huge sample sizes1. Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4 million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90 kb, covering about 21\% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel2) account for 40\% (45\%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10–20\% (14–24\%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries.},

The resulting callsets show consistent quality improvements over those generated using existing best practices with reduced cost.

Currently, the Cistrome DB contains approximately 47,000 human and mouse samples with about 24,000 newly collected datasets compared to the previous release two years ago. Furthermore, the Cistrome DB has a new Toolkit module with several features that allow users to better utilize the large-scale ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq data. First, users can query the factors which are likely to regulate a specific gene of interest. Second, the Cistrome DB Toolkit facilitates searches for factor binding, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility in any given genomic interval shorter than 2Mb. Third, the Toolkit can determine the most similar ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq samples in terms of genomic interval overlaps with user-provided genomic interval sets. The Cistrome DB is a user-friendly, up-to-date, and well maintained resource, and the new tools will greatly benefit the biomedical research community.

	abstract = {Decoding the linguistic intricacies of the genome is a crucial problem in biology, and pre-trained foundational models such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer have made significant strides in this area. Existing works have largely hinged on k-mer, fixed-length permutations of A, T, C, and G, as the token of the genome language due to its simplicity. However, we argue that the computation and sample inefficiencies introduced by k-mer tokenization are primary obstacles in developing large genome foundational models. We provide conceptual and empirical insights into genome tokenization, building on which we propose to replace k-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a statistics-based data compression algorithm that constructs tokens by iteratively merging the most frequent co-occurring genome segment in the corpus. We demonstrate that BPE not only overcomes the limitations of k-mer tokenization but also benefits from the computational efficiency of non-overlapping tokenization. Based on these insights, we introduce DNABERT-2, a refined genome foundation model that adapts an efficient tokenizer and employs multiple strategies to overcome input length constraints, reduce time and memory expenditure, and enhance model capability. Furthermore, we identify the absence of a comprehensive and standardized benchmark for genome understanding as another significant impediment to fair comparative analysis. In response, we propose the Genome Understanding Evaluation (GUE), a comprehensive multi-species genome classification dataset that amalgamates \$36\$ distinct datasets across \$9\$ tasks, with input lengths ranging from \$70\$ to \$10000\$. Through comprehensive experiments on the GUE benchmark, we demonstrate that DNABERT-2 achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model with \$21 {\textbackslash}times\$ fewer parameters and approximately \$92 {\textbackslash}times\$ less GPU time in pre-training.},

However, this is extremely difficult because of the enormous scale of the noncoding mutation space. We developed a deep learning–based framework, ExPecto, that can accurately predict, ab initio from a DNA sequence, the tissue-specific transcriptional effects of mutations, including those that are rare or that have not been observed. We prioritized causal variants within disease- or trait-associated loci from all publicly available genome-wide association studies and experimentally validated predictions for four immune-related diseases. By exploiting the scalability of ExPecto, we characterized the regulatory mutation space for human RNA polymerase II–transcribed genes by in silico saturation mutagenesis and profiled {\textgreater} 140 million promoter-proximal mutations. This enables probing of evolutionary constraints on gene expression and ab initio prediction of mutation disease effects, making ExPecto an end-to-end computational framework for the in silico prediction of expression and disease risk.},

Orca captures the sequence dependencies of structures including chromatin compartments and topologically associating domains, as well as diverse types of interactions from CTCF-mediated to enhancer–promoter interactions and Polycomb-mediated interactions with cell-type specificity. Orca enables various applications including predicting structural variant effects on multiscale genome organization and it recapitulated effects of experimentally studied variants at varying sizes (300 bp to 90 Mb). Moreover, Orca enables in silico virtual screens to probe the sequence basis of 3D genome organization at different scales. At the submegabase scale, it predicted specific transcription factor motifs underlying cell-type-specific genome interactions. At the compartment scale, virtual screens of sequence activities suggest a model for the sequence basis of chromatin compartments with a prominent role of transcription start sites.},

However, we show that it is possible to obtain the private training data from the publicly shared gradients. We name this leakage as Deep Leakage from Gradient and empirically validate the effectiveness on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Experimental results show that our attack is much stronger than previous approaches: the recovery is pixel-wise accurate for images and token-wise matching for texts. We want to raise people's awareness to rethink the gradient's safety. Finally, we discuss several possible strategies to prevent such deep leakage. The most effective defense method is gradient pruning.},

By adapting large language models (LLMs) for genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs) which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By pretraining on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and finetuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the first whole genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing 1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of 121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS.
