To address this challenge, we here introduce GPN-MSA, a novel framework for DNA language models that leverages whole-genome sequence alignments across multiple species and takes only a few hours to train. Across several benchmarks on clinical databases (ClinVar, COSMIC, OMIM), experimental functional assays (DMS, DepMap), and population genomic data (gnomAD), our model for the human genome achieves outstanding performance on deleteriousness prediction for both coding and non-coding variants.},

ESM1b outperformed existing methods in classifying {\textasciitilde}150,000 ClinVar/HGMD missense variants as pathogenic or benign and predicting measurements across 28 deep mutational scan datasets. We further annotated {\textasciitilde}2 million variants as damaging only in specific protein isoforms, demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms when predicting variant effects. Our approach also generalizes to more complex coding variants such as in-frame indels and stop-gains. Together, these results establish protein language models as an effective, accurate and general approach to predicting variant effects.},

The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect.

While language models trained on protein sequences have been studied at a smaller scale, little is known about what they learn about biology as they are scaled up. In this work we train models up to 15 billion parameters, the largest language models of proteins to be evaluated to date. We find that as models are scaled they learn information enabling the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. We present ESMFold for high accuracy end-to-end atomic level structure prediction directly from the individual sequence of a protein. ESMFold has similar accuracy to AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold for sequences with low perplexity that are well understood by the language model. ESMFold inference is an order of magnitude faster than AlphaFold2, enabling exploration of the structural space of metagenomic proteins in practical timescales.},

	abstract = {Identifying causal genetic variants in a computational manner remains an open problem. Training end-to-end prediction models is not possible without large ground-truth datasets, while results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are entangled by linkage disequilibrium (LD), and gene expression datasets do not contain genetic variation at individual-level. Here, we propose Multiple Instance Fine-mapping (MIFM) – a multiple instance learning (MIL) objective to overcome the lack of strong labels by grouping putatively causal variants together based on their LD scores. Using MIFM, we trained a deep classifier on a dataset aggregating over 13, 000 GWAS to predict causal variants based on their underlying DNA sequences. We validated variants prioritized by MIFM by constructing polygenic risk scores which transferred better to different target ancestries. Furthermore, we demonstrated how MIFM can be used to disentangle effect sizes of highly-correlated variants to better fine-map GWAS results.
Author summary Genome-wide association studies have identified tens of thousands genetic variants associated with traits or diseases. However, the majority of identified variants is only spuriously correlated with the phenotype of interest, having no causal effect on it. Instead, these variants are often inherited together with nearby biologically causal variants, thus creating the spurious associations. Fine-mapping, i.e., predicting which variants are causal, is crucial for downstream tasks, such as uncovering the biological mechanisms affecting the phenotype or robustly identifying individuals with high genetic risk of a disease. While most fine-mapping methods are based on the available association statistics or functional annotations of genetic regions, it should be possible to identify causal variants based on their neighboring DNA sequences. However, training a standard machine learning classifier for that task is obstructed by the scarcity of strong, ground-truth labels. Here, we proposed a method to train sequence models predicting variant causality using weakly-labeled data. We trained a model on a large set of associated variants, and demonstrated its utility by improving cross-ancestry predictions of genetic risk, or disentangling the effect sizes of highly correlated variants.},

	abstract = {Fine-mapping refines genotype-phenotype association signals to identify causal variants underlying complex traits. However, current methods typically focus on individual genomic segments without considering the global genetic architecture. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of performing genome-wide fine-mapping (GWFM) and develop methods to facilitate GWFM. In simulations and real data analyses, GWFM outperforms current methods in error control, mapping power and precision, replication rate, and trans-ancestry phenotype prediction. For 48 well-powered traits in the UK Biobank, we identify causal variants that collectively explain 17\% of the SNP-based heritability, and predict that fine-mapping 50\% of that would require 2 million samples on average. We pinpoint a known causal variant, as proof-of-principle, at FTO for body mass index, unveil a hidden secondary variant with evolutionary conservation, and identify new missense causal variants for schizophrenia and Crohn’s disease. Overall, we analyse 600 complex traits with 13 million SNPs, highlighting the efficacy of GWFM with functional annotations.},
