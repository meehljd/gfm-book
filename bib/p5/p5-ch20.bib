	abstract = {Recently, deep neural networks have been successfully applied in many biological fields. In 2020, a deep learning model AlphaFold won the protein folding competition with predicted structures within the error tolerance of experimental methods. However, this solution to the most prominent bioinformatic challenge of the past 50 years has been possible only thanks to a carefully curated benchmark of experimentally predicted protein structures. In Genomics, we have similar challenges (annotation of genomes and identification of functional elements) but currently, we lack benchmarks similar to protein folding competition.},
