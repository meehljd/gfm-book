We present AlphaMissense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89\% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.},

How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequence through the use of a new deep learning architecture called Enformer that is able to integrate long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Notably, Enformer outperformed the best team on the critical assessment of genome interpretation (CAGI5) challenge for noncoding variant interpretation with no additional training. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict promoter-enhancer interactions directly from DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of growing human disease associations to cell-type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution. To foster these downstream applications, we have made the pre-trained Enformer model openly available, and provide pre-computed effect predictions for all common variants in the 1000 Genomes dataset.

Evaluated on quantitative trait loci, Borzoi is competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on individual regulatory functions. By applying attribution methods to the derived statistics, we extract cis-regulatory motifs driving RNA expression and post-transcriptional regulation in normal tissues.

	abstract = {Genomic (DNA) sequences encode an enormous amount of information for gene regulation and protein synthesis. Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context ({\textless}0.001\% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers or fixed k-mers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyena's new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level - an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics. On fine-tuned benchmarks from the Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA reaches state-of-the-art (SotA) on 12 of 18 datasets using a model with orders of magnitude less parameters and pretraining data. On the GenomicBenchmarks, HyenaDNA surpasses SotA on 7 of 8 datasets on average by +10 accuracy points. Code at https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna.},

We pinpoint a known causal variant, as proof-of-principle, at FTO for body mass index, unveil a hidden secondary variant with evolutionary conservation, and identify new missense causal variants for schizophrenia and Crohn’s disease.

	abstract = {Identifying causal genetic variants in a computational manner remains an open problem. Training end-to-end prediction models is not possible without large ground-truth datasets, while results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are entangled by linkage disequilibrium (LD), and gene expression datasets do not contain genetic variation at individual-level. Here, we propose Multiple Instance Fine-mapping (MIFM) – a multiple instance learning (MIL) objective to overcome the lack of strong labels by grouping putatively causal variants together based on their LD scores. Using MIFM, we trained a deep classifier on a dataset aggregating over 13, 000 GWAS to predict causal variants based on their underlying DNA sequences. We validated variants prioritized by MIFM by constructing polygenic risk scores which transferred better to different target ancestries. Furthermore, we demonstrated how MIFM can be used to disentangle effect sizes of highly-correlated variants to better fine-map GWAS results.
Author summary Genome-wide association studies have identified tens of thousands genetic variants associated with traits or diseases. However, the majority of identified variants is only spuriously correlated with the phenotype of interest, having no causal effect on it. Instead, these variants are often inherited together with nearby biologically causal variants, thus creating the spurious associations. Fine-mapping, i.e., predicting which variants are causal, is crucial for downstream tasks, such as uncovering the biological mechanisms affecting the phenotype or robustly identifying individuals with high genetic risk of a disease. While most fine-mapping methods are based on the available association statistics or functional annotations of genetic regions, it should be possible to identify causal variants based on their neighboring DNA sequences. However, training a standard machine learning classifier for that task is obstructed by the scarcity of strong, ground-truth labels. Here, we proposed a method to train sequence models predicting variant causality using weakly-labeled data. We trained a model on a large set of associated variants, and demonstrated its utility by improving cross-ancestry predictions of genetic risk, or disentangling the effect sizes of highly correlated variants.},

A significant challenge, however, resides in accurately decoding genomic sequences, which inherently involves comprehending rich contextual information dispersed across thousands of nucleotides. To address this need, we introduce GENA language model (GENA-LM), a suite of transformer-based foundational DNA language models capable of handling input lengths up to 36 000 base pairs. Notably, integrating the newly developed recurrent memory mechanism allows these models to process even larger DNA segments. We provide pre-trained versions of GENA-LM, including multispecies and taxon-specific models, demonstrating their capability for fine-tuning and addressing a spectrum of complex biological tasks with modest computational demands. While language models have already achieved significant breakthroughs in protein biology, GENA-LM showcases a similarly promising potential for reshaping the landscape of genomics and multi-omics data analysis. All models are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/GENA\_LM) and on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/AIRI-Institute).

For coding effects, we tested CADD on 31 Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) data sets from ProteinGym and, for regulatory effect prediction, we used saturation mutagenesis reporter assay data of promoter and enhancer sequences. The inclusion of new features further improved the overall performance of CADD.
