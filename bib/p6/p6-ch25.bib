	abstract = {The expanding catalog of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provides biological insights across a variety of species, but identifying the causal variants behind these associations remains a significant challenge. Experimental validation is both labor-intensive and costly, highlighting the need for accurate, scalable computational methods to predict the effects of genetic variants across the entire genome. Inspired by recent progress in natural language processing, unsupervised pretraining on large protein sequence databases has proven successful in extracting complex information related to proteins. These models showcase their ability to learn variant effects in coding regions using an unsupervised approach. Expanding on this idea, we here introduce the Genomic Pre-trained Network (GPN), a model designed to learn genome-wide variant effects through unsupervised pretraining on genomic DNA sequences. Our model also successfully learns gene structure and DNA motifs without any supervision. To demonstrate its utility, we train GPN on unaligned reference genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and seven related species within the Brassicales order and evaluate its ability to predict the functional impact of genetic variants in A. thaliana by utilizing allele frequencies from the 1001 Genomes Project and a comprehensive database of GWAS. Notably, GPN outperforms predictors based on popular conservation scores such as phyloP and phastCons. Our predictions for A. thaliana can be visualized as sequence logos in the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/gbenegas/gpn-arabidopsis). We provide code (https://github.com/songlab-cal/gpn) to train GPN for any given species using its DNA sequence alone, enabling unsupervised prediction of variant effects across the entire genome.},

Here, we present the Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine Pretrained Transformer (CpGPT), a novel foundation model pretrained on over 1,500 DNA methylation datasets encompassing over 100,000 samples from diverse tissues and conditions. CpGPT leverages an improved transformer architecture to learn comprehensive representations of methylation patterns, allowing it to impute and reconstruct genome-wide methylation profiles from limited input data. By capturing sequence, positional, and epigenetic contexts, CpGPT outperforms specialized models when finetuned for aging-related tasks, including chronological age prediction, mortality risk, and morbidity assessments. The model is highly adaptable across different methylation platforms and tissue types. Furthermore, analysis of sample-specific attention weights enables the identification of the most influential CpG sites for individual predictions. As a foundation model, CpGPT sets a new benchmark for DNA methylation analysis, achieving strong performance in the Biomarkers of Aging Challenge, where it placed second overall in chronological age estimation and first on the public leaderboard in methylation-based mortality prediction.

A major obstacle in integrating omics data from multiple modalities is that different omics layers typically have distinct feature spaces.

Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE.},

Here we propose deep rare variant association testing (DeepRVAT), a model based on set neural networks that learns a trait-agnostic gene impairment score from rare variant annotations and phenotypes, enabling both gene discovery and trait prediction. On 34 quantitative and 63 binary traits, using whole-exome-sequencing data from UK Biobank, we find that DeepRVAT yields substantial gains in gene discoveries and improved detection of individuals at high genetic risk.

	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are relative measures of an individual’s genetic propensity to a particular trait or disease. Most PRS methods assume that mutation effects scale linearly with the number of alleles and are constant across individuals. While these assumptions simplify computation, they increase error, particularly for less-represented racial groups. We developed and provide Delphi (deep learning for phenotype inference), a deep-learning method that relaxes these assumptions to produce more predictive PRS. In contrast to other methods, Delphi can integrate up to hundreds of thousands of SNPs as input. We compare our results to a standard, linear PRS model, lasso regression, and a gradient-boosted trees-based method. We show that deep learning can be an effective approach to genetic risk prediction. We report a relative increase in the percentage variance explained compared to the state-of-the-art by 11.4\% for body mass index, 18.9\% for systolic blood pressure, 7.5\% for LDL, 35\% for C-reactive protein, 16.2\% for height, 29.6 \% for pulse rate; in addition, Delphi provides 2\% absolute explained variance for blood glucose while other tested methods were non-predictive. Furthermore, we show that Delphi tends to increase the weight of high-effect mutations. This work demonstrates an effective deep learning method for modeling genetic risk that also showed to generalize well when evaluated on individuals from non-European ancestries.},

Being high dimensional, incorporation of such data in one model is a challenge, often leading to one-dimensional studies and, therefore, information loss. Instead, we first propose relying on non-fixed sets of whole genome or whole exome variant-associated sequences, which can be used for supervised learning of oncology-relevant tasks by our Set Transformer based Deep Neural Network, SetQuence. We optimise this architecture to improve its efficiency. This allows for exploration of not just coding but also non-coding variants, from large datasets. Second, we extend the model to incorporate these representations together with multiple other sources of omics data in a flexible way with SetOmic. Evaluation, using these representations, shows improved robustness and reduced information loss compared to previous approaches, while still being computationally tractable. By means of Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods, our models are able to recapitulate the biological contribution of highly attributed features in the tumours studied. This validation opens the door to novel directions in multi-faceted genome and exome wide biomarker discovery and personalised treatment among other presently clinically relevant tasks.},

As proof-of-concept, we use G2PT to model the genetics of TG/HDL (triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), an indicator of metabolic health. G2PT predicts this trait via attention to 1,395 variants underlying at least 20 systems, including immune response and cholesterol transport, with accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art. It implicates 40 epistatic interactions, including epistasis between APOA4 and CETP in phospholipid transfer, a target pathway for cholesterol modification.

	abstract = {In light of the rapid accumulation of large-scale omics datasets, numerous studies have attempted to characterize the molecular and clinical features of cancers from a multi-omics perspective. However, there are great challenges in integrating multi-omics using machine learning methods for cancer subtype classification. In this study, MoGCN, a multi-omics integration model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) was developed for cancer subtype classification and analysis. Genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics datasets for 511 breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) samples were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The autoencoder (AE) and the similarity network fusion (SNF) methods were used to reduce dimensionality and construct the patient similarity network (PSN), respectively. Then the vector features and the PSN were input into the GCN for training and testing. Feature extraction and network visualization were used for further biological knowledge discovery and subtype classification. In the analysis of multi-dimensional omics data of the BRCA samples in TCGA, MoGCN achieved the highest accuracy in cancer subtype classification compared with several popular algorithms. Moreover, MoGCN can extract the most significant features of each omics layer and provide candidate functional molecules for further analysis of their biological effects. And network visualization showed that MoGCN could make clinically intuitive diagnosis. The generality of MoGCN was proven on the TCGA pan-kidney cancer datasets. MoGCN and datasets are public available at https://github.com/Lifoof/MoGCN. Our study shows that MoGCN performs well for heterogeneous data integration and the interpretability of classification results, which confers great potential for applications in biomarker identification and clinical diagnosis.},

Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context ({\textless}0.001\% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers or fixed k-mers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyena's new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level - an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics. On fine-tuned benchmarks from the Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA reaches state-of-the-art (SotA) on 12 of 18 datasets using a model with orders of magnitude less parameters and pretraining data. On the GenomicBenchmarks, HyenaDNA surpasses SotA on 7 of 8 datasets on average by +10 accuracy points. Code at https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna.},

	abstract = {Identifying causal genetic variants in a computational manner remains an open problem. Training end-to-end prediction models is not possible without large ground-truth datasets, while results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are entangled by linkage disequilibrium (LD), and gene expression datasets do not contain genetic variation at individual-level. Here, we propose Multiple Instance Fine-mapping (MIFM) – a multiple instance learning (MIL) objective to overcome the lack of strong labels by grouping putatively causal variants together based on their LD scores. Using MIFM, we trained a deep classifier on a dataset aggregating over 13, 000 GWAS to predict causal variants based on their underlying DNA sequences. We validated variants prioritized by MIFM by constructing polygenic risk scores which transferred better to different target ancestries. Furthermore, we demonstrated how MIFM can be used to disentangle effect sizes of highly-correlated variants to better fine-map GWAS results.
Author summary Genome-wide association studies have identified tens of thousands genetic variants associated with traits or diseases. However, the majority of identified variants is only spuriously correlated with the phenotype of interest, having no causal effect on it. Instead, these variants are often inherited together with nearby biologically causal variants, thus creating the spurious associations. Fine-mapping, i.e., predicting which variants are causal, is crucial for downstream tasks, such as uncovering the biological mechanisms affecting the phenotype or robustly identifying individuals with high genetic risk of a disease. While most fine-mapping methods are based on the available association statistics or functional annotations of genetic regions, it should be possible to identify causal variants based on their neighboring DNA sequences. However, training a standard machine learning classifier for that task is obstructed by the scarcity of strong, ground-truth labels. Here, we proposed a method to train sequence models predicting variant causality using weakly-labeled data. We trained a model on a large set of associated variants, and demonstrated its utility by improving cross-ancestry predictions of genetic risk, or disentangling the effect sizes of highly correlated variants.},
